<small>THE FIRE ALARM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“You’re going, aren’t you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!”</p>

<p>“Will you be there, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Jerry. It ought to be quite a
meeting, I should say.”</p>

<p>“You said something!” exclaimed Ned Slade,
with an air of conviction. “Things will whoop up
in great shape. Why, there hasn’t been so much
excitement in Cresville since I can remember.”</p>

<p>“Not since the old lumberyard burned,” added
Jerry Hopkins, as he walked down the street, one
arm linked in that of Ned Slade on his left, and
the other hooked up with Bob Baker’s on his
right. “It doesn’t seem possible that we’ve been
drawn into this, after all the President did to
keep us out; but it’s true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it’s true!” exclaimed Ned. “The
President goes before Congress and asks for the
whole strength of the nation to back him up, and
defy Germany. And he gets it, too!”</p>

<p>“That’s what he does,” added Jerry. “It’s one
of the strongest declarations about the war I ever
read; and we’ve had a chance to read a few in
the last two years. America against Germany!
I never expected it, but, now it’s come, we’ll have
to get in it good and strong.”</p>

<p>“And we’ve got to hustle, too!” added Bob
Baker.</p>

<p>“That’ll be something new for you, Chunky!”
observed Jerry Hopkins, with a chuckle. “You’re
getting fatter than ever,” and he caught some of
his friend’s superfluous flesh between thumb and
finger and made Bob squirm.</p>

<p>“Quit it!” the latter begged. “What do you
think I’m made of, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I was just trying to find out,” answered Jerry,
innocently. “’Tisn’t as firm as it might be, but
when we get back to Boxwood Hall, and you have
a little tennis or football to harden you up, I think
you’ll feel better.”</p>

<p>“I’d feel better right now if you’d quit pinching
me!” exclaimed the tormented one. “Try it
on Ned a bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t need waking up,” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Jerry. “But say, do we need tickets for this
meeting to-night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” remarked Bob, whose
nickname of Chunky fitted him well. “But let’s
go down the street and read one of the notices.
There’s one in front of Porter’s drug store. And
while we’re there we can——”</p>

<p>“Get chocolate sodas! I know you were going
to say that!” broke in Ned. “Say, I thought you
were on a diet, Chunky. The idea of taking
chocolate! Don’t you know it’s fattening?”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about chocolate sodas?”
demanded the fat one. “I didn’t mention it!”
and he glared at Ned. But Jerry was between
the two.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t, little one!” returned Ned
sweetly. “But you were going to, and I made
it easy for you. However, I don’t believe one
chocolate will hurt you; and since you are going
to buy——”</p>

<p>“Who said I was?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you?” asked Ned, with an assumption
of innocence. “I’m sure I heard
Chunky invite us to have sodas. Didn’t you,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” was the ready answer. “Don’t try to
back out, Bob. It’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s of no use trying to buck up against
a conspiracy like this,” sighed the stout youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“I guess I’ve got the price,” and he rattled some
change in his pocket.</p>

<p>The trio of lads, nodding now and then to acquaintances
they passed, kept on down the street
until they reached Porter’s drug store. In the
window was a placard announcing a patriotic
meeting to be held in the auditorium that evening,
for the purpose, as it stated, of:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Upholding President Wilson, and proving to
him that Cresville approves of his course in declaring
a state of war with Germany exists.</i>”</p></div>

<p>“No tickets needed,” read Jerry. “It’s a case
of first come first served, I guess.”</p>

<p>They entered the drug store, and soon were being
served, talking, the while, of the coming patriotic
meeting.</p>

<p>“Colonel Wentworth is going to preside,” announced
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’ll be enough rhetorical fireworks
to stock a battleship,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, the old soldier means all right,” added
Bob, who seemed to be of a kind and mellow disposition,
now that he was having something to
eat. Eating, as may have been guessed, was one
of Chunky’s strong points. “There isn’t a more
patriotic citizen than Colonel Wentworth,” went
on the stout youth, stirring his chocolate ice-cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
soda to mix it well before drinking. “He did his
share in the Spanish war, and now he’s anxious
to volunteer again, I hear.”</p>

<p>“He’s a little too old, isn’t he?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s in fine shape. Well, we’ll go
to the meeting, anyhow, and help whoop things
up.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Jerry Hopkins.
“These are the days to show your colors.”</p>

<p>It will be evident to the reader that the period
of the opening of this story was in the spring,
following the announcement of war between the
United States and Germany.</p>

<p>Of the events leading up to that announcement
nothing need be said here, for they are too well
known. But even though every one who had
closely followed the trend of thought and happenings,
knew there was nothing for an honor-loving
and conscientious nation to do except take
the step advocated by President Wilson, still the
actual declaration that a state of war existed,
when it was made, came as a shock.</p>

<p>Then followed the reaction. A reaction which
resulted in the holding of many meetings, in the
organization of many societies and in new activities
in many that were already organized.</p>

<p>The New England town of Cresville, the home
of Ned, Bob and Jerry, was no exception to this
rule. It was a progressive town, or small city if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
you will, and numbered among its members citizens
of worth and patriotism. So it is not
strange that a meeting should be called to “back
up” the President.</p>

<p>The meeting had its inception with Colonel
Wentworth, a Son of the Revolution, an officer in
the Spanish-American war, where he had fought
with the regulars both in Cuba and in the Philippines,
and an all-around true-hearted and red-blooded
American. He felt that Cresville should
make her position known, and in order to stir
her blood, as well as add fuel to his own, he proposed
the holding of a patriotic mass meeting, at
which a number of speakers should be heard. A
United States Senator had promised to come and
tell something of the events leading up to the formal
declaration of war.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, home from their college,
Boxwood Hall, for the Easter vacation, had read
the notices of the meeting, and, having followed
with interest the course of events in America preceding
the entrance of the United States into the
war and also having closely observed the course
of England, France, Russia and Italy against a
common enemy, had decided to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>They had planned to take a motor trip to a distant
city, to attend a concert by the Boxwood Hall
Glee Club and a dance afterward, at which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
boys expected to meet some young ladies in whom
they were more than ordinarily interested. But
when Jerry had seen the notices posted for the
patriotic rally he had said to his chums:</p>

<p>“Fellows, the dance racket is off! We’ve got to
show ourselves at the auditorium.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Ned had answered. “Dad’s a
great friend of the colonel’s, and he’s going with
mother. He told me I ought to show myself
there, and I guess we’ll have to.”</p>

<p>So it was decided, and, a few hours after having
been the guests of Chunky at the soda fountain,
Ned and Jerry, with their stout companion,
found themselves part of a throng at the door of
the town auditorium, a newly constructed meeting
place.</p>

<p>“Some push!” exclaimed Ned, as he felt himself
being carried forward in the crush, for the
doors had just been opened.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a success all right,” added
Jerry. “They’ll never get ’em all in!”</p>

<p>The hall was, indeed, filled, and standing room
was at the proverbial premium when Colonel
Wentworth, visibly proud of the success of his
undertaking, advanced to welcome the gathering
and to introduce the first speaker.</p>

<p>There was the speaking usual at such a meeting,
only this time it was tinged with a deeper
note of seriousness. America had not yet awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the realization of what war really meant,
and was going to mean. And some of the speakers
tried to bring this home to the people of Cresville.</p>

<p>The meeting was rather long, and even though
they were as full of fire, zeal, energy and patriotism
as any person there, Ned, Bob and Jerry,
after two hours of speech-making, began to wish
themselves out of the place. They felt they had
done their duty, and were longing for a little
change, when it came, most unexpectedly.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the rear of the hall, close
to the main entrance doors, when Ned heard a
sound that made him suddenly sit up.</p>

<p>“Hear that?” he asked, in a whisper, of Jerry.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Fire alarm! It’s from the box down near
dad’s store! I’m going to see what it is!”</p>

<p>He rose softly, so as not to disturb the speaker.
The sound of the alarm could be plainly heard.
Bob and Jerry also arose and made their way
out, as did several others. An undercurrent of
excitement seemed to pervade the meeting. As
the boys reached the door, there came from the
street a cry of fear.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE RUNAWAY ENGINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Jerry of his two
chums, when they were in the anteroom of the
auditorium, and could speak without disturbing
the meeting.</p>

<p>“Sounded as if some one was hurt,” added Ned.</p>

<p>A number of men and boys had come out at
the same time as had the three friends, and one of
them now hurried to the door and looked down
the street. There were a number of electric
lights, and, as the trees were bare of leaves, a
good view could be had.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried the man who had made
the observation. “Look!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“The fire engine horses are running away!”
was the excited answer. “The driver’s been
thrown off, and the horses are pulling the engine
down Hoyt street hill lickity-split! Say, there’ll
be a smash-up all right!”</p>

<p>It did seem so, as Ned, Bob and Jerry noted
a moment later, when they hurried out in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the auditorium and gazed down the thoroughfare.
The engine could plainly be seen, smoke
and sparks pouring from it, for the automatic
apparatus, that starts a blaze under the boiler,
had been set going by the engineer as the steamer
pulled out of its quarters.</p>

<p>The engine was a new one for Cresville, being
one of two purchased to replace the old hand-drawn
pumping affairs that had so long done duty
in the town.</p>

<p>“Come on!” suddenly exclaimed Jerry Hopkins,
and he led his two chums over toward his
auto, the trio having come to the meeting in the
powerful machine.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Catch those horses!” replied Jerry as he hurried
on.</p>

<p>And in the momentary pause that ensued, while
he and his friends were getting in the car, to
give pursuit to the runaway fire engine steeds, I
will take a brief moment to acquaint my new
readers with the chief characters of this story.</p>

<p>Those of you who formed your friendship for
the chums in the book called “The Motor Boys,”
know Ned, Bob and Jerry full well by this time.</p>

<p>Jerry Hopkins was the son of a rich widow of
Cresville, and was the leader of the trio, the three
boys having been chums, friends and inseparable
companions for many years. Bob Baker, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
known as “Chunky,” was the son of Andrew
Baker, a banker of the town, while Ned Slade’s
father kept the chief department store in Cresville.
As already stated, this town, or city, as
its more enthusiastic admirers called it, was in
New England, not far from Boston.</p>

<p>As may be guessed from the title of the first
book, the lads were much interested in machines
propelled by gasoline motors. Their initial venture
was with motor cycles, after their bicycle
days, and then they secured an automobile, in
which they went on many a tour, even down into
Mexico, as related in other volumes of the “Motor
Boys Series.”</p>

<p>They later acquired a motor boat and voyaged
on the Atlantic and Pacific, and several books are
devoted to their activities in this regard. As
might be expected, the perfection of the aeroplane
gave the boys a chance for new activities, and they
ventured above the clouds more than once.</p>

<p>From the heights to the depths was a natural
descent, and a submarine took the motor boys
under the ocean where they had more than one
thrill. Then they went back to their motor car
and boat again; and had more exciting times on
road and river.</p>

<p>In “The Motor Boys at Boxwood Hall; or,
Ned, Bob and Jerry as Freshmen,” the seventeenth
book of this series, you will find our heroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in a new phase. Too long, their parents decided,
had they been living a free and careless life, with
no systematic studying to fit them for the struggle
that lay before them. So they were sent to
school again, and Boxwood Hall was the place
selected for them.</p>

<p>Because a certain clique there had the idea that
these lads regarded themselves too seriously, there
was a conspiracy formed against Ned, Bob and
Jerry at the school, and they entered under a
handicap. How they worked it off, and came in
“first under the wire,” will be found fully set
down. Also may be read how the faithful trio,
at the last moment, turned what might have been
an athletic defeat into victory, and, incidentally,
helped a fellow student to develop his character
along the right lines.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker were financially interested
in a certain western cattle ranch, and
when it was learned that serious thefts had taken
place there the motor boys were eager to go out
and try to solve the mystery. How they did is
told in “The Motor Boys on a Ranch.”</p>

<p>From then on matters at Boxwood Hall went
more smoothly, and Ned, Bob and Jerry were
accorded the place to which they were entitled.</p>

<p>They had now come home for the Easter vacation,
to find their town plunged in war excitement,
in which the whole country shared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean you’re going to chase after that
engine in this car?” asked Bob, as he managed
to fling himself into the rear seat, while Jerry and
Ned took the front one and the former started
the motor.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m going to do,” Jerry answered.
“If Jim Foster, the driver, has been
thrown off, there’s no one aboard to stop the fire
horses.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jim was thrown off all right!” exclaimed
Ned. “They’ve picked him up, and are carrying
him into Doctor Newton’s place.”</p>

<p>“Hank Tedder, the engineer, is hanging on all
right,” added Bob, as he peered down the street
and observed a man clinging to the rear of the
swaying engine.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he can’t climb over and get into Foster’s
seat and stop the horses,” decided Jerry, as
he turned on more speed and swung his big touring
car after the engine ahead of him. “This is
the only way to stop those frightened horses.”</p>

<p>“Unless some one gets in front of ’em and
brings ’em up,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Who’d take a risk like that?” asked Bob, from
the rear seat. “In fact, I don’t see how you are
going to work it, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know myself; but I’m going to
try. You know the way a mounted policeman
stops a runaway team is to ride up alongside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them, get his horse to going at the same speed as
the bolters, and then gradually bring them to a
stop.”</p>

<p>“And you’re going to try that?” asked Bob, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not? It’s the only thing to do,”
answered Jerry, calmly. “If those horses keep
on down the Hoyt street hill they’ll go smack into
the river! It’s a pity they didn’t get auto engines
while they were at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Ned. “Keep on,
Jerry, old man!”</p>

<p>“I will! Hold tight, though, fellows, when it
comes to the last lap. There may be an upset!”</p>

<p>Indeed the boys were taking a desperate chance.
The frightened horses, hitched to the heavy engine,
were pulling it along at top speed, and the
downward slope of the street added to their momentum.
As yet the grade was gradual, but, a
little farther on, the slant was more decided, leading
down to the river.</p>

<p>Hoyt street turned at the end, and went along
the river bank, but at the speed they were going
it would be impossible for the horses to make the
turn, the boys thought.</p>

<p>By this time a number of persons, some of whom
had left the meeting, were in the street, following
after the runaway engine, and shouting wildly.
One or two persons in automobiles started after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the speeding horses, but Jerry’s car was well in
the lead, though the horses had a good start.</p>

<p>The engineer of the steamer, realizing the danger
should any pedestrians or persons in vehicles
get in the path of the wild horses, pulling the tons
of steel and fire behind them, kept the whistle
going spasmodically.</p>

<p>The new engine house, as are all those in cities,
was fitted with a device to keep steam at ten
pounds pressure constantly in the boiler. When
the engine pulled out this pressure was enough to
operate the whistle, and when the fire was started
there was soon steam enough to work the pump,
in case it should prove to be needed.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of the fire?” asked Bob,
as Jerry’s car speeded on.</p>

<p>Ned looked up. The number of the alarm box
indicated that it was in the neighborhood of his
father’s large department store. And he was
relieved when he saw no tell-tale glare in the sky.
But the danger of the runaway engine was still
present. Could Jerry reach and stop the team
in time?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>“JUST AS EASY!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Down the hill thundered the fire engine, the
man on the back step keeping the whistle going.
Behind the steamer came the powerful automobile
containing Ned, Bob and Jerry, and after them
came a crowd of men and boys, while a car or
two, not having the speed advantage of the motor
boys’ vehicle, trailed after.</p>

<p>“If they make the turn into Water street, a
block above the river, they’ll be safe,” said Ned
to his tall chum beside him in the seat. “The
hill isn’t so steep there. But if they keep on down
past Water street——”</p>

<p>“It’s into the water for them!” grimly finished
Jerry Hopkins. “We’ll try to stop them before
they get there.”</p>

<p>He gave the auto a little more gasoline, and it
leaped forward. At the same moment Bob
yelled:</p>

<p>“There it is! See the blaze!”</p>

<p>He pointed off to the left, and there a glare in
the sky, which increased in brightness as the boys
looked, could be observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“One of the tenements over in Frogtown!” exclaimed
Ned, naming a poor section of Cresville
where lived a number of foreigners who worked
in the various factories. Of late a number of
new industries had sprung up in the place, and the
foreigners, who made up a large share of the
workmen, were quartered in long rows of tenement
houses, on the outskirts of Cresville, the
place being styled “Frogtown,” because built on
filled land, where once had been a frog-infested
pond.</p>

<p>“If those shacks get to going there’ll be some
fire,” murmured Ned. “And they’ll get a good
start if the engine doesn’t soon reach the place.”</p>

<p>“Some one ought to send in another alarm, and
bring out the other engine,” added Bob. “This
one won’t be much good if it goes to smash.”</p>

<p>“We’ve no time to send in alarms now,” muttered
Jerry. “Let some one else do that. We’ve
got to stop those horses if we can!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob clung to the sides of the car.
This was in the lead now, and nothing was between
their automobile and the swaying, rumbling
engine.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned gave a cry and pointed to something.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry. “Another fire?”</p>

<p>“Look at that old man! Right in the path of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the engine! The horses’ll be on him in a minute!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Bob, from the rear
seat. “Hi there! Get out the way!” he yelled.
“Don’t you see the engine?”</p>

<p>Certainly the man at the side of the road, standing
in the full glare of an arc electric light, ought
to have heard the rattle of the runaway engine,
even if he did not see it, though the place was well
illuminated, and there was then no other vehicle
in sight, save the automobile of the motor boys.
There was something familiar about the odd figure,
but neither Ned, Bob nor Jerry had time
just then to look closely enough to make out who
it was.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing?” asked Jerry, as he skillfully
guided his machine and turned on a little
more speed, for he was nearing the engine, and
wanted to be in a position to stop the runaway
horses if he could.</p>

<p>“He seems to be picking up something off the
ground, under the light,” went on Ned. “Get
out the way! Get out the way!” he yelled.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the little man at the
side of the street seemed aware of what was going
on.</p>

<p>“Look at him!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’s right in the way of the horses!” added
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he’s going to try to stop ’em!” came from
Bob. “Oh, boy! what’ll happen to him?”</p>

<p>And it was plain to the three chums that the little
man was going to make an effort to stop the
runaways. At this point there was a slight upward
slant to the street, before it made the turn
over the hill down to the river.</p>

<p>The horses had slackened their speed somewhat,
but they were still running at a smart pace,
when the little man, first laying something carefully
down in the grass at a safe distance from
the road, stepped out, and began running alongside
the runaways.</p>

<p>“He knows something about the game,” murmured
Ned. “Lots of folks that try to stop a
runaway horse get right in front. The only way
to do is to get alongside and grab the reins.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he’s doing! That’s what he’s
<em>done</em>!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>And, indeed, the small man had. He ran
alongside the off horse, until he could reach up
and grab the reins, and then he hung on and let
his weight tell. And it did, too, slight as it was.
That, and the effect of his voice (for the boys
could hear him calling to the steeds to stop), combined
with the fact that the horses were tired and
had a little hill before them, gradually brought
the runaways to a stop. The nigh horse slipped
and fell heavily, but the other retained its feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and so did the little man who had brought the animals
to a stop.</p>

<p>“Say, did you see him do it?” cried Jerry to
his chums.</p>

<p>“I should say yes!” chimed in Bob.</p>

<p>“Just as easy!” murmured Ned, admiringly.
“Just as easy!”</p>

<p>“He certainly did know how to do it,” agreed
Jerry, as he brought the automobile to a stop near
the throbbing engine, for now there was a good
head of steam up. The boys ran to where the little
man still stood. Ned was the first to reach
him. The boy gave a cry.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jerry, in surprise.</p>

<p>“It’s our old friend, Professor Uriah Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>“Great rattlesnakes, so it is!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>And it was, indeed, the professor, now a member
of the faculty of Boxwood Hall, and a companion,
more than once, of the boys on their
trips.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Professor?” asked Jerry, as he
hurried to the side of the little scientist, while
the fireman of the steamer came forward to relieve
Mr. Snodgrass of the care of the standing
horse.</p>

<p>“Hurt? No. Why?” asked the surprised scientist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why because you stopped that runaway.”</p>

<p>“Runaway? Was that a <em>runaway</em>?” asked
Professor Snodgrass in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course it was!” cried Ned. “Didn’t you
know it?”</p>

<p>“A runaway? No, my dear boy, I did not. I
heard some yelling, and I saw the fire engine coming
my way. But the reason I stopped it was because
a little while ago I saw, just beyond, in the
road, a most curious bug of a kind that only appears
early in April in this locality. I was eager
to get it, and I was afraid, if the horses and engine
trampled the roadway, that I would lose the
exceedingly rare specimen. That’s why I stopped
the animals. I had no idea that it was a runaway,
but I’m glad if I have been of any service.
If you’ll excuse me, now, I’ll go and look for that
bug,” and, as though it was his custom every evening
after supper to stop a runaway fire engine in
danger of plunging into the river, Professor Snodgrass
turned aside and began searching in the
dust for the bug he wanted. Off to one side, in
the grass where he had carefully placed it before
stepping out to stop the horses, was the collecting
box the boys knew so well.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the limit?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Same old professor. Hasn’t changed a bit,”
observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, considering it was only about three weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ago that we left him at Boxwood Hall, there
hasn’t been much time for change,” returned Ned,
with a laugh. “But say, fellows, what’s to be
done?” he went on. “That fire’s growing worse,
and it looks as though one of these horses was
out of business.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said Hank Tedder, the engineer.
“His leg’s broke. He’ll never pull another engine.
And how I’m going to get this steamer to
the fire—first alarm it’s ever responded to—I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>The boys did not either—that is Ned and Bob
did not. But Jerry did. He was always resourceful.</p>

<p>“Unhitch the horses!” he cried to Hank.
“Push the engine back so it clears, and we’ll tow
it to the fire with our auto.”</p>

<p>“Can you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure. We’ve got plenty of power, and it’s
a level road from here on. Downhill, if anything.
You can ride on the seat, Hank, and put
on the brake when it’s needed. Come on, boys!”</p>

<p>“All right. And it can’t be any too soon!”
murmured Bob, as he looked at the reddening
sky.</p>

<p>“They may send the other engine,” said Jake
Todger, another fireman who came up in some
one’s automobile just then. He worked to free
the injured horse while the boys unharnessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
other one. Professor Snodgrass seemed to have
forgotten about everything but the bug he was
looking for in the dust of the road, under the
electric light.</p>

<p>With straps from the harness, and a strong towline
carried on the auto, the machine was soon
hitched to the steamer, and then Jerry once more
took his position at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Going to leave the professor here?” asked
Bob, as Hank climbed to the driver’s seat of the
steamer, while Jake got on behind.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to,” replied Ned. “I didn’t
know he was in town. He must have just arrived,
and probably he has come to pay one of us
a visit. He’ll look us up later—when he’s found
that bug. Best to leave him alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jake. “Anything to
get to the fire. This has been an awful night!”</p>

<p>“And it’s only just begun,” observed Jerry, as
he thought of the patriotic meeting he and the
others had left to go to see where the fire was.</p>

<p>Off started the powerful automobile pulling the
engine, while the red blaze in the sky grew
brighter.</p>

<p>“Some fire, boys!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we aren’t going to get there any too
soon.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if we can save any of the old shacks
if they get going.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Ned, Bob and Jerry as they sat in
the automobile, pulling the fire engine along the
road. It was not as easy as Jerry had thought
it would be, and he had to use the utmost power
of his car, strong as it was; for the steamer was
heavy, and the roads were of dirt. But it was
the only solution of the difficulty, with one horse
disabled, and no others immediately available.</p>

<p>“Can you make it, boys?” asked Hank, from
his seat in front of the throbbing engine.</p>

<p>“We will make it, or bust a cylinder!” exclaimed
Jerry, as he turned off the road into a
cross street that led to Frogtown, the scene of
the fire.</p>

<p>On chugged the automobile, and behind it rumbled
the fire engine. The machine was not of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
heaviest construction, or perhaps Jerry’s car, powerful
as the latter was, could not have pulled it.
But, as it happened, it was possible to move it
along at good speed, and they were soon at the
head of the street on which stood the burning
structure.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the big tenements!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s gone beyond saving, I guess,”
added Jerry. “The engine didn’t get here in
time.”</p>

<p>This was evident to all. The tenement, a long,
rambling structure of wood, three stories high, was
blazing at one end. Already about half of it
had been consumed and had fallen in red ruins.
The wind was blowing the flames toward the unburned
portion, and it was only a question of time
when it would all go.</p>

<p>“Here comes the other engine!” some one
shouted, as Jerry drew the one he was pulling up
to a fire plug.</p>

<p>“They’d better try to save the rest of the block,
and let this shebang go!” exclaimed Jake Todger,
as he jumped down and began to attach the big
hose from the hydrant to the pump.</p>

<p>Two hose carts were on hand, one belonging
to the engine the boys had pulled to the fire, and
the members of the department began to attach
the line to the engine.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a stream on in a jiffy!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Jake. “But the second engine’d better play on
the other end of the block to keep that from
catchin’.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the idea of the chief of the
fire department, for he came rushing up, and
gave orders that the tenement adjoining the one
that was ablaze, should be kept wet down.</p>

<p>“You play on the fire itself, Jake!” the chief
ordered. “What happened to your engine, and
where’s the driver?”</p>

<p>“Pitched off and hurt, I guess. Bad, too. The
horses ran away an’ one’s got a busted leg. Jerry
Hopkins and his chums pulled the engine here
with their auto.”</p>

<p>“Good for them! Well, get busy.”</p>

<p>Jerry ran his car out of the way, and then the
engine he had brought to the blaze began pumping.
Soon two powerful streams were available,
one playing on the blaze itself, and the other forming
a curtain of water to prevent the fire from
spreading.</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?” asked Jerry of the chief.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. We got most of the folks
out before your engine got here. I’m much
obliged to you. I don’t know what we’d have
done if we hadn’t had both engines.”</p>

<p>The fire was a fierce one, and many of the families
had hurried out with only a small portion of
their possessions. But it was something to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
escaped with their lives, for the fire was caused
by the explosion of an oil stove a woman was using,
and the flames spread rapidly. The woman
was badly burned, as was one of her children, and
they had been taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>“Think they can save any of it?” asked Bob of
Jerry, as they stood watching, having put their
automobile in a safe place.</p>

<p>“Not any of the tenement that’s burning, I
don’t. They’ll be lucky if the rest of the block
doesn’t go.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” added Ned. “Say,
hadn’t we better go back to the professor?” he
asked. “Maybe he’ll think it funny of us to have
gone off and left him.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know him better than that by
this time!” exclaimed Jerry, with a laugh. “He
won’t think about anything but that bug he’s trying
to catch. The idea of stopping a runaway
team of fire engine horses, and not knowing it!
Just stopped ’em because he thought they’d trample
on some insect! And then you think he’ll
feel hurt if we don’t come back after him!</p>

<p>“Just let him alone. Sooner or later he’ll show
up at one of our homes, and then we can find out
what he’s doing in this neighborhood now.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s planning some expedition to
South America, or some place like that, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wants us to go with him,” said Bob. “We have
had some corking times with him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that doing now,” observed Ned.
“We’ve got to stick on at Boxwood Hall, I expect.
Of course it’s a dandy place, and all that,
but I would like a trip off into the wilds. And
if we could take Professor Snodgrass along it
would be dandy.”</p>

<p>But events were to shape themselves differently
for the motor boys. Those of you who have read
the previous books of the series need no introduction
to Professor Snodgrass. He was a scientist
of learning and attainments, and in the boys
he had firm friends. They had taken him with
them on nearly all of their trips, by automobile,
in the airships, in the submarines, and when they
journeyed in their motor boats.</p>

<p>The professor had been connected with colleges
and museums, for his services as a collector
and curator of insects and reptiles were much in
demand. He was an enthusiast of the first water,
and would do even more desperate and risky
things to secure a rare bug than stopping a runaway
fire engine.</p>

<p>Of late he had headed a department at Boxwood
Hall, and the boys were glad of this, for he
proved as good a friend to them there as he had
afield on their various trips.</p>

<p>They had left him at Boxwood, about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
weeks before, quietly and peacefully cataloging
some of his insects, and now they beheld him in
the midst of considerable excitement. The professor
seldom sent word that he was coming. He
just came.</p>

<p>“Look!” suddenly cried Jerry, as he and his
chums stood watching the blaze. “What’s the
idea over there?” and he pointed to where some
firemen were raising a ladder at the still unburned
end of the blazing tenement.</p>

<p>“Looks like a rescue,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” said Bob. “They’re taking
down an old woman!”</p>

<p>“And some children!” added Jerry.</p>

<p>This was what was going on. Two families, in
the top story of the end of the structure not yet
directly on fire, had either been overlooked in the
other rescues, or they had hidden away in fear,
and were not seen.</p>

<p>Now some one had either told of them, or the
unfortunates had been seen at the windows, and a
call was given for a ladder. One was raised
against the wall, and two firemen went up. They
succeeded in bringing down the woman and the
children, who had been trapped when the stairs
burned away.</p>

<p>A cheer greeted the plucky efforts of the firemen,
for the rescue was not an easy one. Ned,
Bob and Jerry joined in the tribute. All around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was the crackle of flames, and thick clouds of
smoke rolled here and there, smarting eyes and
choking throats. The throbbing and puffing of
the steamers mingled with the shouts and orders
that flew back and forth.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry arose at the far end of the burning
tenement; the end that could not longer be
held back from the flames.</p>

<p>The three chums ran to where the cry sounded,
and observed, leaning out of a second story window
on the end of the house, an old man. Smoke
poured from the window back of him, and behind
him could be seen the ruddy flames, ever coming
nearer.</p>

<p>“Another one they’ve forgotten,” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Or else he hid away, or has been unconscious,”
added Bob.</p>

<p>“They’ve got to get him soon!” exclaimed
Jerry.</p>

<p>But the firemen, and there were none too many
of them even with the whole department out, were
busy elsewhere. Some were attending the nozzles,
others were helping at the engines and some
were still carrying to places of safety the women
and children brought down from the front of the
blazing structure.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get him down!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“If we only had a ladder!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Here’s one!” shouted Bob, and he pointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a short one that had been thrown on the ground,
evidently as of no use in reaching the women and
children who were taken from the floor higher up.</p>

<p>“Will it reach?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to try,” Jerry yelled. “Bring it
over!”</p>

<p>With the aid of his chums, he raised it against
the window. Just then part of the house fell in,
and the crowd surged back, thinking to get out
of danger, so the boys were left comparatively to
themselves in making this rescue.</p>

<p>“Hold the ladder at the foot, Bob,” directed
Jerry; “it isn’t any too firm. Ned and I’ll go up
and see if we can get him down.”</p>

<p>The old man, half choked from smoke, was
leaning from the window now, shouting as well as
he could with his feeble breath.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump!” yelled Ned. “We’re coming
after you!”</p>

<p>Quickly he started up the ladder, followed by
Jerry. The old man held out his arms to them
imploringly.</p>

<p>Bob braced himself against the foot of the ladder
to prevent it from slipping, and for once in
his life he was glad that he was fat and heavy.
He made a good anchor.</p>

<p>“Keep still! We’re coming! We’re coming!”
yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>The aged man was excited and fearful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
small wonder. The smoke, pouring from the window
around him, was thicker now, and the flames
back of him were brighter.</p>

<p>Up and up went Ned and Jerry. When they
came closer they could hear the old man shouting:</p>

<p>“My money! My money! I must get my
money and the jewelry!”</p>

<p>They were at the window now, the ladder just
reaching to it, with not a foot to spare.</p>

<p>“Never mind about your money and jewelry!”
shouted Jerry. “You’ll be lucky to get off with
your life. Come on, we’ll help you down!”</p>

<p>“No, I must get my money! I can not afford
to lose it! I must go back and get it, and get the
jewelry! They took some but I saved the rest.”</p>

<p>He turned as though to hobble back into the
smoke filled and fire encircled room.</p>

<p>“You’ll be burned to death if you go!” shouted
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must get my money!” whined the
aged man. “Crooked Nose came for it, but I
hid some of it away from him. I must get it. I
don’t want Crooked Nose to get it! Oh, wait until
I get my money!” and he disappeared from
the casement.</p>

</div>


<p>“We’ve got to get him!” cried Jerry to Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! He’ll be burned to death in there
in less than a minute! What’s he mean about
Crooked Nose?”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I know! But don’t stop to ask
questions. Go on up. I’ll be right after you.
We’ve got to get him. Stand firm, Bob!” Jerry
yelled to his chum at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>“Right!” answered the stout one, making his
voice heard above the various noises of the fire.</p>

<p>Up the ladder went Ned and Jerry, pausing a
moment as they got to the point where they could
look into the room. The smoke had blown away
for the time being.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Ned, pointing to a figure
huddled on the floor.</p>

<p>The two boys leaped into the room, taking big
gulps of fresh air to hold in their lungs as long as
possible, for they saw that the wind was blowing
the smoke into the room again.</p>

<p>They caught hold of the old man. He appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to be a Frenchman, though he spoke good
English. The boys lifted him up, and this seemed
to restore his scattered senses.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” he murmured. “My money!
I must get my money. And that jewelry!
Crooked Nose got some of it, but I hid the most.
He shan’t have it! I must save it. In the iron
box! Get it for me! Don’t let Crooked Nose
have it!”</p>

<p>“He’s raving!” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk! Save your breath!” mumbled
Jerry, doing just what he warned his chum against.
“Catch hold and——”</p>

<p>He did not finish, but nodded in the direction
of the open window. The room was lighted by
the reflection of flames outside. Ned understood,
and, taking hold of the old man’s legs one of which
seemed to be crippled, while Jerry supported his
head, they carried him to the casement.</p>

<p>Jerry got out first, while Ned held the old man,
who kept muttering something about “Crooked
Nose,” and “money and jewelry.” The boys paid
little attention then, though the time was to come
when the incident would be brought back to them
in a startling manner.</p>

<p>Once again on the ladder, Jerry called:</p>

<p>“Now work him out till he hangs over my
shoulder like a sack of flour, Ned. I can carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
him down that way. He isn’t heavy. Hold him
steady until I give the word.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered his chum, and then the
two proceeded to save the old man. Ned shifted
the burden until it rested on the window sill. The
Frenchman was either unconscious now, or incapable
of motion, for he was as limp and inert
as Jerry could wish, and he was easier to handle
in that way. Getting him over his shoulder, as
he might a sack of flour, Jerry started down the
ladder with his burden.</p>

<p>Ned gave one last look around the room where
the old man seemed to have lived all alone. There
was a bed in one corner, and a stove in the other,
with a few poor possessions.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything of Crooked Nose or a
box of money, or jewelry either,” murmured Ned.
“I guess he was out of his head through fear. I
might take another look, but——”</p>

<p>Just then there was a sound indicating that a
large portion of the structure had fallen in. This
was followed by such a burst of flame and smoke
into the room that Ned was almost trapped. He
made a dive for the window and got out on the
ladder. Down it he hurried, after Jerry and his
burden, and he was not a moment too soon, for
an instant later the flames burst from the window
in a volume sufficient to have overwhelmed any
one who had been in the apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just in time,” murmured Ned, as he came to
the ground, a few seconds after Jerry reached it.</p>

<p>Willing hands took the burden of the old man,
and he was carried to a place where volunteer
nurses and a physician worked over him.</p>

<p>By this time the tenement house was a mass
of flames. The fire involved the end where the
old Frenchman had lived, and there was no hope
of saving it. The place was like a tinder-box,
and soon after Jerry and Ned had left it the roof
at that end fell in.</p>

<p>Quickly the fire burned itself out, and then came
the problem of caring for the unfortunates who
had lost nearly everything, and who were homeless.
Kind friends and neighbors took in such as
they could.</p>

<p>“How’s our Frenchman?” asked Ned of Jerry,
as they were about to go to their automobile and
depart for home, since the high point of the excitement
had passed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We might take a look.”</p>

<p>A policeman directed them to a near-by store,
where several firemen and spectators had been
treated for cuts from glass or partial smoke suffocation,
and there the boys found the old
Frenchman. He was a cripple, with a stiff left
leg, and had suffered much from shock. He was
in great distress of mind.</p>

<p>“These are the boys who brought you down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the ladder, who saved you,” said a doctor, pointing
to Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>The man murmured something in his own expressive
language, and then, as if realizing that
the boys could not understand very well, though
they knew some French, he said, in English:</p>

<p>“I can never thank you enough! You saved
my life! But tell me, did you see Crooked Nose
or my iron box of money and jewelry?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Jerry gently. He thought the
old man was still wandering in his faculties.</p>

<p>“Who is Crooked Nose?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He is a villain!” exclaimed the Frenchman,
whose name, some one said, was Jules Cardon.
“He is a villain who tried to rob me of all I had.
He got some of my money and some of the jewelry,
but the rest I put in the iron box and locked.
Then I hid it. But the fire came and I could not
find it. Then I remember no more. But if you
find Crooked Nose you will catch a great scoundrel,
and perhaps find my money and the precious
jewelry.”</p>

<p>“Is Crooked Nose a man?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes. He came to see me this evening. He
knew me in France—many years ago. He demanded
money. I would not give it to him, and
he said he would take it, or he would—— Well,
he made threats. I hid most of the money and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the jewelry, but I forgot where I put it when the
fire came. Oh, was it burned?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it was left in there I should say it
was,” replied Jerry, as he looked at the glowing
ruins. “Nothing much left there.”</p>

<p>“But maybe Crooked Nose took it,” suggested
Mr. Cardon. “He is a villain.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>The crippled old Frenchman shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would be of no use to tell you,” he said.
“He changes his name too often. Crooked Nose,
I call him. He can’t change that!”</p>

<p>The old man seemed much improved, bodily,
but his mental anguish was pitiable. Again and
again he implored to be allowed to go back and
look for his money, but of course this could not
be. What was left of the ruins was a mass of
blazing wood.</p>

<p>Then, when he seemed to think that all was lost,
the old man became calmer, and told a more connected
story.</p>

<p>The old Frenchman was an engraver by trade
and had worked for many years in New York,
doing fine engraving for some leading jewelers.
Then he had become crippled by an accident and
had moved to Cresville for his health. In Cresville
he had managed to pick up considerable work
from the local jewelers, doing the engraving on
rings, watches, and silver and gold ware for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have much jewelry to engrave!” he said,
with a sorrowful shake of his head. “I have a
fine gold watch, and a silver tea set, and a magnificent
diamond brooch, and other things. Now—where
are they?” and he shrugged his shoulders
despairingly.</p>

<p>“Gee, that will be a big loss for somebody!”
remarked Ned.</p>

<p>Just before the fire broke out the old Frenchman
had had a visitor. This, as he explained,
was a “queer stick of a man with a very crooked
nose.”</p>

<p>“He got it in a fight in France many years ago,”
said Mr. Cardon. “I had not seen him in a long
time. How he found me and my money and the
jewelry I do not know. But he threatened, and
would have hurt me, had I not given him some.
But I hid the most of it, and then the fire came.
It came after Crooked Nose went out. Maybe
he set the blaze. He was wicked enough. Oh,
my money is lost—and that jewelry I was trusted
with!”</p>

<p>“It is if it was in there. But maybe that fellow
you call Crooked Nose got it,” suggested
Jerry. “You can have a look in the ruins after
they cool.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more the motor boys could
do, and, learning that some of the neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
would care for the old Frenchman, they got ready
to go home.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better go back and see what has
become of Professor Snodgrass?” asked Bob, as
they reached their automobile.</p>

<p>“Well, it might be a good plan,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Some of the bugs he is after may have carried
him off,” suggested Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>They started for the place where the runaway
fire horses had been caught by Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“This has been what you might call a ‘large’
evening,” remarked Jerry, as he guided the car.</p>

<p>“Somewhat juicy,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Speaking of juicy reminds me of a broiled
steak,” put in Bob. “What do you say to a little
supper? I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“For once I agree with your gastronomic suggestion,”
replied Jerry. “What say, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I’m with you. Let’s include the professor if
we can find him.”</p>

<p>They reached the scene where they had last
observed their friend, but he was not in sight.
The horse lay there, having been shot to end its
suffering, and then the boys went on into town.</p>

<p>There they telephoned to their people that they
were all right and would be home later, at the
same time mentioning the fact that Professor
Snodgrass was in town, and would probably call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
if he did not get on some bug-hunting chase that
kept him out all night.</p>

<p>As the boys entered a restaurant they almost
collided with, or, rather, were fairly run into by,
a man who seemed in great haste. He acted in
a peculiar manner, turning his face aside as if to
escape observation, and hurried on out.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a gentleman!” angrily murmured
Jerry, who had received the full impact of the
odd character.</p>

<p>“Didn’t even say: ‘Excuse me!’ did he?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Nothing like it. He must be going to catch
a train!”</p>

<p>Bob, who was just behind his chums, turned
quickly and looked after the man.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Did I <em>see</em> him. I <em>felt</em> him!” declared Jerry,
with a rueful laugh.</p>

<p>“And did you notice?” went on Bob, in some
excitement.</p>

<p>“Notice what?” Ned inquired.</p>

<p>“His crooked nose! It was all on one side of
his face. Say, fellows, maybe that’s the man who
tried to rob the old Frenchman!” exclaimed Bob
in a tense whisper.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

</div>


<p>Jerry and Ned looked at Bob quickly, and then
darted glances after the man who had so rudely
pushed out of the door, almost upsetting Jerry on
his way.</p>

<p>“Did he really have a crooked nose?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“He sure did! I had a good view of his side
face, and his nose looked as though he had been
a football player most of his life, and had fallen
on his nose instead of on the pigskin.”</p>

<p>Ned darted out to the sidewalk, and looked up
and down the street. He came back to report.</p>

<p>“The man, Crooked Nose or not, isn’t in sight,”
he said. “But if you think it’s worth while postponing
the meal——”</p>

<p>“No, don’t!” hastily begged Bob. “Maybe
after we caught up to him it wouldn’t be the right
man.”</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to agree with you there,” said
Jerry. “We have only this Frenchman’s word for
it, and there is probably more than one man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a crooked nose in Cresville. We can’t go up to
the first chap we meet who’s decorated that way
and accuse him of taking money and jewelry or
setting fire to a house. It won’t do.”</p>

<p>“No,” assented Ned. “We might properly
call him down for his manner of colliding with us,
but that isn’t criminal. I guess we’ll just have to
let him go, and second Bob’s motion to hold a
grub-fest. I have an appetite, even with all the
smoke I swallowed.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Jerry. “That Frenchman
may have been dreaming. But he tells a funny
story, and Crooked Nose, as we’ll call him until
we think of a better name, did seem to want to
get off without being recognized.”</p>

<p>“He actually seemed afraid of us,” went on
Ned. “He came out of here like a shot as soon
as he saw us. I’m sure there’s something wrong
about him, and there may be more in the Frenchman’s
story than has yet come out.”</p>

<p>“We can go and see him to-morrow,” suggested
Jerry. “But we’d better look after Professor
Snodgrass a little now. He may be at one of
our houses expecting us; that is, if he hasn’t found
a new colony of bugs.”</p>

<p>So the boys proceeded with their meal, talking
meanwhile about the events of the night.</p>

<p>“I wonder how the patriotic meeting made
out?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can pass there on our way home,” said
Jerry. “I guess there will be plenty of such from
now on, since Uncle Sam has decided to take a
fall out of the Kaiser.”</p>

<p>But as the boys, in their automobile, rode past
the auditorium, it was closed and dark, showing
that the meeting was over. That it was a success
they heard from several persons to whom they
spoke as they rode through the streets of the small
city on their way to Jerry’s house, since it was decided
to stop there first, to see if Professor Snodgrass
was visiting Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>And it was there they found him, talking to
Jerry’s mother, who was entertaining the little
scientist, meanwhile wondering what was keeping
the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, how does it feel to be a hero?” asked
Ned, as he greeted the professor.</p>

<p>“A hero?” murmured Mr. Snodgrass, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Didn’t he tell you, Mother?” inquired
Jerry. “He stopped the team that was running
away with the fire engine and——”</p>

<p>“And you never mentioned it, Professor!” exclaimed
Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Too modest!” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>“Really, I never gave it a thought,” said the
visitor. “In fact, I didn’t notice anything about
the vehicle in question. I only saw some horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
coming down the road, and I didn’t want them to
step on a colony of bugs I wished to investigate.
That is all there was to it. But did the fire
amount to anything, boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was some fire,” answered Bob. “And,
what’s more, Jerry and Ned did a bit of hero work
themselves,” and he related the incident of the
rescue of the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t anything!” declared Jerry, as
he saw his mother looking proudly at him. “Bob
was in it, too. If he hadn’t been so fat he couldn’t
have kept the ladder from slipping.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Ned. “I guess we
can all congratulate ourselves.”</p>

<p>“How was the meeting?” asked Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“We didn’t hear much of it,” answered Jerry.
“Came out when it was less than half over, to
see about the fire, and we’ve been busy ever since.
But say, Professor, what do you think about this
declaration of war with Germany?”</p>

<p>“I think it was the only thing the people of the
United States could do with honor and with a regard
for their own rights and the cause of humanity,”
was the quick answer. “We’ll all have
to get into the fight sooner or later, and in one
way or another. I think there are stirring times
ahead of us, boys.”</p>

<p>The talk became general, and Professor Snodgrass
told of having heard from a fellow scientist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that a certain kind of insect was to be found in
the vicinity of Cresville, and so he had decided
to come on a little expedition in the few days that
remained of the Easter vacation.</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you,” declared Jerry. “Are
you counting on going anywhere else after bugs?”</p>

<p>“Not just at present,” answered the scientist.
“I have found just what I want right here, so it
won’t be necessary to get out the airship or the
submarine this time.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could,” sighed Ned. “It seems a
shame that all our good times have to be curtailed
for a while, and that we have to go back
to Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“That’s the place for you boys, for some years
yet,” said Mrs. Hopkins. “You have had your
share of fun, and you must now be content to do
a little serious work.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” chimed in Professor Snodgrass.
“But I have not given up all hope of making other
trips with you boys. I haven’t forgotten the stirring
times we have had. There may be more
ahead of us, though when the country actually
gets into war every one will have to give up some
pleasures.”</p>

<p>The boys related the incidents of the fire, incidentally
speaking of the Frenchman’s real or
fancied loss of his money and the jewelry and
about the man with the crooked nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I think I know that crippled Frenchman!”
cried Mrs. Hopkins suddenly. “He does work
for Mr. Martley, the jeweler. Oh, I wonder if
it can be true,” and she gave a gasp.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mother?” demanded Jerry, who
saw that something was wrong.</p>

<p>“I sent that new diamond brooch I bought last
month at Martley’s back to be engraved. Perhaps
Mr. Martley let that Frenchman have it.”</p>

<p>“He mentioned a diamond brooch.”</p>

<p>“If it is mine and it is gone!” Mrs. Hopkins
clasped her hands. “It cost eight hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“In that case Martley will have to pay for it,”
added Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jerry. But it will make a lot of trouble,”
sighed his mother.</p>

<p>“Was that man’s nose bent to the left?” asked
Professor Snodgrass, looking up from a dried bug
he was inspecting, for he carried specimens in almost
every pocket, and looked at them whenever
he had a chance.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it was quite a bend, too,” said Bob.
“Why do you ask, Mr. Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“Because I think I saw the same man shortly
after you boys left me to go to the fire, dragging
the engine with your auto. I was in the middle
of the road, getting some of the insects into my
specimen box, when I was almost trodden on by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a man who was hurrying past. I looked up to
remonstrate with him, and then I saw that he had
a very crooked nose. Before I had a chance to
say all I wanted to about his manners, or, rather,
lack of them, he hurried on.”</p>

<p>“It must have been the same chap,” declared
Jerry. “His rudeness shows that. He did the
same thing to us. We must keep our eyes open,
and, if we see him around town, we’ll find out
who he is.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass not only spent the night
at Mrs. Hopkins’ house, but his visit extended
over several days.</p>

<p>During that time some highly interesting facts
came to light.</p>

<p>It was learned that at the time of the fire the
old crippled French jeweler had had a great number
of things in his possession to engrave, entrusted
to him by two of the local jewelers, Mr.
Martley and Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>Among the things given to him by Mr. Martley
were the diamond brooch belonging to Mrs. Hopkins
and also a gold watch which was the property
of Mr. Baker, Bob’s father. Both of these
valuable articles were now missing—and even
when the ruins of the fire were searched they were
not brought to light.</p>

<p>Of course both Mrs. Hopkins and Mr. Baker
were much disturbed, and so was Mr. Martley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The jeweler was in a bad way financially, and this
made matters worse than ever for him. His creditors
came down on him immediately and the
next day he had to make an assignment. The
other jeweler was better fixed and settled up
promptly for his losses.</p>

<p>“It looks as if my father would be out his
watch,” said Bob to his chums. “And such a fine
timepiece too! It cost a hundred and sixty dollars!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t as bad as my mother’s loss,” returned
Jerry. “That diamond brooch cost eight
hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“Martley was a fool to trust the old Frenchman
with the things.”</p>

<p>“He knows that—now. Not but what I guess
the old man was honest enough. But it was a
careless thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Crooked Nose got the things.”</p>

<p>“If he did, I hope we get Crooked Nose.”</p>

<p>“So do I. I don’t think we’ll get much out of
Martley. He’s too deeply in debt, so I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was still at the Hopkins
home and the boys went with him on one or two
short trips, looking for bugs. But there was, on
their part, not much interest in the work. They
were, as was every one else in town, too much absorbed
in the exciting events that followed the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the United States into the war against
Germany.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the fire, when Ned,
Bob and Jerry were out in their automobile, discussing
what they would do at the coming term
of school, that they passed a newspaper office and
stopped to read the bulletin.</p>

<p>“Look at that, fellows!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob, whose view was obstructed
by Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s a call for volunteers to fight the Kaiser,”
was the answer. “There may be a draft, later,
fellows, and the volunteers are the boys who go
first!” Jerry rose in his seat to read the bulletin
over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>“The first call for volunteers,” he murmured.
Then, with a suddenness that was startling, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Fellows, this hits us! I’m going to offer myself
to Uncle Sam! Are you with me?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>CHUNKY’S TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned Slade clapped Jerry Hopkins on the back
with such vigor that the latter almost lost his
balance.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“It means I’m with you!” was the answer.
“We’ll all enlist and start for the other side as
soon as they’ll let us! I was just wishing for
some excuse to get out of going back to Boxwood
Hall, and this’ll be it all right!”</p>

<p>“Do you think we can make it?” asked Bob.
“I mean will our folks let us cut school?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so,” answered Jerry easily, though,
to tell the truth, he had some doubts about it.</p>

<p>“Let’s go somewhere and ask about enlisting,”
suggested Ned. “We want to get into this
as soon as we can, and the sooner the better.
There must be some way of finding out the quickest
way of getting into the army.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and ask Colonel Wentworth,” suggested
Jerry. “He’ll know, all right.”</p>

<p>“You said it!” agreed Ned. “Say, this is
great! I wonder if——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>He was interrupted by a cheer from the crowd
in front of the bulletin board.</p>

<p>“Are they applauding our recent determination
to enlist?” asked Jerry, as the car started up the
street toward the office of Colonel Wentworth.</p>

<p>“No, it’s just a new item on the bulletin board,
about the state militia being mobilized.”</p>

<p>“That means business,” said Jerry. “Oh, boy!
but I hope we can get into this game from the very
start.”</p>

<p>They drove to the office of Colonel Wentworth,
who carried on a real-estate business when he was
not making patriotic addresses. They found the
old soldier holding forth to a circle of friends
about what the United States ought to do, and
what it ought to avoid, in the coming conflict.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, boys!” he greeted Ned,
Bob and Jerry. “Come in and sit down. I’ll attend
to you in just a moment. Now, as I was saying,
Mr. Benson——”</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t come on business; that is, not
real-estate business,” said Jerry quickly. “And
we don’t want to take up much of your time. We
just want to ask where’s the nearest place to go to
enlist, and how do you do it.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Colonel Wentworth sparkled
brightly. He clasped the hand of Jerry Hopkins
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, gentlemen? Didn’t I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
say that the youth of this land would rally to the
colors as soon as the call went forth? Here is
proof of it! Boys, I’m proud of you! Cresville
will be proud of you! And generations to come
will be proud of you!”</p>

<p>The colonel seemed starting on one of his orations,
but he caught himself in season and said:</p>

<p>“There is no time like the present. There is a
recruiting station of the regular army at Richfield,”
naming the nearest large city. “I’ll take
you over there and see that you sign up. Are you
old enough to enlist without the consent of your
parents? If you’re not we’ll first stop and see
them and——”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better stop and see them anyhow,”
suggested Ned. “We’re none of us twenty-one
yet, and I guess it’d be better to get formal
permission.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would,” the colonel told them. “I
have not the slightest doubt in the world but what
the consent will be given, but it makes it easier if
it is first obtained.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go home then,” went on Ned, “and get
the consents in writing. What we wanted to
know was the nearest place to volunteer, and
you’ve told us that.”</p>

<p>“Glad to have done it!” exclaimed the enthusiastic
colonel. “Don’t hesitate to call on me if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
can be of the slightest assistance to you. Good-bye
and good luck!”</p>

<p>And, as they left his office, Ned, Bob and Jerry
could hear the former soldier telling his friends:</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit of ’Seventy-six reincarnated!
That’s what’s going to beat the Kaiser!”</p>

<p>“I hope we get a shot at him all right,” murmured
Jerry, as they went down to their automobile.
“What do you think about your folks,
Ned? Will they let you go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so. I heard dad saying the other
night he wished he was young enough to enlist,
so he ought to be glad to have me take his place.”</p>

<p>“I fear my mother will make a fuss at first,” said
Jerry, “but she’ll give in finally, I think. The one
trouble will be about school. She has her heart
set on having me graduate from Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you can come back and finish the
course,” said Ned. “How does it strike you,
Chunky? You won’t be sorry to cut the books,
will you?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” was the rather slow answer.
“Oh, of course I’ll be glad to get out of going
back to Boxwood Hall. It’s nice there, and all
that, but I’d rather go to a soldier’s camp.”</p>

<p>There was something in the way Bob spoke that
made Ned remark to Jerry, a little later:</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the matter with Chunky?
He didn’t seem to enthuse very much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he didn’t, that’s a fact,” admitted Jerry.
“Maybe he has a little indigestion.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would have, the way he eats.
But I don’t believe it’s indigestion this time.
Something’s wrong with Bob, and I’d like to know
what it is.”</p>

<p>But Ned was so occupied with his own affairs,
wondering whether or not his parents would consent
to his enlisting, that he did not give the matter
of his stout chum much consideration just then.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, there was a momentary
opposition on the part of Mrs. Hopkins
as regarded Jerry, and on the part of Mr. and
Mrs. Slade and Mr. and Mrs. Baker as to their
sons. And it was not from any lack of patriotism.
It was merely that they felt the boys were a little
too young to be of real service to their country.</p>

<p>“If you were a little older, I’d at once say go,”
said Mrs. Hopkins to Jerry. “I want you to
serve your country. But I think you can best do
it, now, by getting a good education, and enlisting
later.”</p>

<p>“It may be too late then, Mother,” said Jerry.
“There is talk of a draft, and while those who go
under the forced call will be just as good soldiers
as the volunteers, I’d like to volunteer.”</p>

<p>“But what about school? I don’t want to see
you lose all the advantage your studies will give
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can take them up later.”</p>

<p>Both Jerry and his mother, as did other boys
and other parents, seemed to ignore the chance that
there would be many who would not come back.
But it is always that way, and it is a good thing
it is.</p>

<p>“What are Bob’s parents, and Ned’s, going to
do?” asked Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>In the end there was a family council, and the
matter was gone over in detail. The boys were
so much in earnest, as the war fervor swept over
the country, that Mr. Slade said:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see, as patriotic citizens, that we
can do any less than let our boys do their share.
They are strong and healthy. There will be
no trouble about passing the physical tests, I
imagine.”</p>

<p>“The only trouble is about school,” said Mr.
Baker. “The spring term is about to begin, and
I understand there are some important studies to
be taken up in anticipation of the final examinations.”</p>

<p>“There are,” said Ned. “But we aren’t the
only ones who will be out of school. Lots of the
boys are volunteering. And some have already
gone to France to drive ambulances or fly aeroplanes.
Fully a score of the fellows we know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and some we aren’t intimate with, won’t come back
to Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure about this?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“I had it from Professor Snodgrass,” was the
answer, for by the time of this family council the
scientist had returned to Boxwood Hall. “And,
what’s more, a lot of the members of the faculty
are going to volunteer, also. Boxwood Hall
won’t be the same place it was before the war.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case,” said Mr. Baker, “probably
some rules will be made about those who drop out
on account of volunteering. They may be given
certain credits, and allowed to make up the lost
time by degrees. I don’t see, Mrs. Hopkins and
Mr. Slade, but what the boys have won their
point.”</p>

<p>“Then are we to consent to their enlisting?”
asked Jerry’s mother, and she was not ashamed
of the tears in her eyes nor the catch in her voice,
for Jerry was an only son and his mother was a
widow. When Jerry went there would be only
his sister Susie left.</p>

<p>“I shall consent to Ned’s going,” said Mr.
Slade.</p>

<p>“And Bob has my permission,” added Mr.
Baker. “He’s getting too stout, anyhow. It
may do him good.”</p>

<p>“You may go, Jerry,” said Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Fine, Mother! I knew you’d say I might!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
And now, boys, let’s go and see Colonel Wentworth
and find out what the next step is.”</p>

<p>They hurried to their automobile and were soon
speeding toward the office of the former soldier.
He received them with delight, and gave them a
letter of introduction to the recruiting officer at
Richfield.</p>

<p>“Let’s go right over and sign up!” proposed
Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Might as well,” added Ned. “How about it,
Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose if we’re going to enlist we’ve
got to sign, or do something, but I was thinking
we might wait a few days and——”</p>

<p>“Wait?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>Bob did not answer at once, but on his face
there was a troubled look. His chums wondered
what it meant.</p>

<small>A PRO-GERMAN MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Look here, Chunky!” exclaimed Jerry, after
a quick glance at Ned, “I may as well say what’s
on my mind, and get it out of my system. Both
Ned and I have been wondering about you,
lately.”</p>

<p>“Wondering about me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, about the way you’re acting on this enlistment
business. You want to volunteer and
join the army, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sure I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t act very happy over it,” put in
Ned. “You were enthusiastic at the start, and
then you simmered out. Are you getting cold
feet? You’re not——”</p>

<p>“I’m not <em>afraid</em>, if that’s what you mean!”
blurted out Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t going to say that,” put in Ned,
quickly. “No one who knows you, as Jerry and
I know you, would ever accuse you of that.
You’ve gone through too many tight and dangerous
places with us to have us say that you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
afraid. And yet something has happened, hasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I s’pose you could call it that,” assented
Bob slowly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to renege in the matter of
volunteering?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But you aren’t as keen on it as you were at
first!” declared Ned. “What’s the matter, Bob?
Are you in trouble, Chunky, old man?” and he put
his arm affectionately over his chum’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes, fellows, I am in trouble,” said Bob, and
he spoke desperately. “I almost wish I hadn’t
agreed to enlist! That I’d waited for the draft,
and then——”</p>

<p>“What are you saying?” cried Jerry in amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean that then I’d have a good excuse
to go to war, and I couldn’t help myself,” and Bob
floundered a good deal in his explanation.</p>

<p>“Why do you need an excuse?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I suppose I may as well tell you.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” broke in Ned. “Bob, this is
getting a bit personal, I know, but the end justifies
the means, I think. Have you been to see Miss
Schaeffer lately?”</p>

<p>Bob looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Last night,” he answered. “You ought to
know. You left me there in the car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I did. But I have a reason for asking.
Doesn’t her father own some stock in a Boston
German paper?”</p>

<p>“I believe he does,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And the paper has been one of the strongest
advocates against the United States taking any
part in this war, as I happen to know,” went on
Ned. “It came out flatly, and justified the sinking
of the <i>Lusitania</i> on the ground that it was
carrying munitions to England. The same paper
has taunted Uncle Sam, since the declaration of
war, with siding with our old enemy, Great
Britain. Am I right, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s true. But Helena hasn’t anything
to do with the paper.”</p>

<p>“No, but she can’t help siding with her father,
and he helps to dictate the policy of that slanderous
German sheet! Bob, tell me the truth; isn’t
the Schaeffer family pro-German?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose they are. It’s natural——”</p>

<p>“It isn’t natural!” burst out Jerry. “If any
so-called German-Americans want to side with the
Kaiser let them go back to Germany where they
belong. Uncle Sam hasn’t any use for ’em!
Bob, I didn’t think this of you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be too severe on Chunky!” interposed
Ned. “He hasn’t done anything yet. I
know just what the situation is, I think. Bob,
you have come to the parting of the ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
You’ve either got to go with us or stay home.
What are you going to do? I can see, of late,
that you have been rather cold toward this enlistment
proposition. Now that won’t do. If you
want to wait for the draft, well and good.
That’s your business, of course. But we’d hate
to see you do it.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Jerry. “I never
dreamed of this. What does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s his girl—Helena Schaeffer,” said Ned.
“Isn’t it true, Bob, that she has spoken to you
against volunteering?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has, and that’s what makes me worry.
I was going to keep still about it, and try to work
everything out myself. But I don’t believe I can.
You know— Oh, well, I’m awfully fond of
Helena, and I think she likes me, a little. This
is among friends, of course.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured Jerry and Ned.</p>

<p>“And she’s as good as said that if I enlist to
fight against Germany, when her father is so fond
of the old Kaiser, and what he represents, that
she’ll—well—she and I will have to part company,
that’s all!” and Bob blurted out the words.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” and Ned asked
the question relentlessly. This was no time for
half-way measures, he felt.</p>

<p>Bob did not answer for a moment. They were
talking in the street in front of Colonel Wentworth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
office. And then, at what seemed a most
opportune moment, a phonograph in a near-by
store began playing one of the popular songs of
the day; a song with the lilt of marching steps and
an appeal for every one to do his duty and fight
for Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Bob straightened up. His eyes grew brighter
and he squared his shoulders in a way his chums
well know.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he exclaimed, “I’ve been a fool to hold
back one minute on this thing. If you’ll wait a
little while, I’ll come back and give you my answer.
And you don’t have to guess what it is, either.”</p>

<p>He started off down the street.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a talk with Helena,” Bob
answered.</p>

<p>“Wait and we’ll take you to her corner in the
auto. Might as well ride as walk,” called Ned.
“We’ll wait for you at my house.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned did not say much to Chunky
during the ride. They thought it best to let him
work out the problem in his own way. And it
was better done without suggestion from them.</p>

<p>“See you later,” said Ned, as his stout chum
left the car and started down the street toward the
Schaeffer home.</p>

<p>“What do you think he’ll do?” asked Jerry, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Ned turned the car in the direction of his own
home.</p>

<p>“The right thing,” answered Ned. “Chunky is
all right. It’s just that he’s a little fascinated by
Helena, who, to do her justice, is a mighty pretty
girl. It’s too bad she has pro-German tendencies.
And yet it isn’t so much her as it is her father
who influences her. She is a nice girl, and mighty
sensible, too, except on this one point. I know,
for I’ve been there with Chunky. That’s why I
happened to know how the bug had bitten him.</p>

<p>“Even before we got into this war against Germany
Mr. Schaeffer was ranting about the unneutrality
of this country, and declaring that we
were favoring England and France and discriminating
against the Kaiser. I wish we’d done more
of it! We wouldn’t have it so hard as we’re
going to have it from now on.”</p>

<p>“But about Chunky. Do you think he’ll tell his
friend that he is going to enlist and let her make
the best of it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Or the worst—yes. I think Bob will do just
that. He was wobbling the least bit, but I think
he’s on his feet now. We’ll wait for him to come
back.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bob Baker was having his own
troubles. He had made the acquaintance of Miss
Schaeffer some time before, when it seemed there
would be never a question as to what nationality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a person claimed. But the war had made a difference.</p>

<p>As Ned had stated, Mr. Schaeffer was one of
the owners of a rabid German paper, published
in Boston, and the editorial policy was against
anything French or English, and against the
United States helping the Allies in any way.</p>

<p>When the United States formally entered the
war the sheet did not dare come out and openly
espouse the cause of Germany, but in underhand
ways and by sly insinuations it sought to deprecate
the cause of the Allies and tried to say, only
too plainly, that the United States had no business
entering the war, and that the youth of the land
would do well to keep out of it. In other words
it discouraged enlisting.</p>

<p>Just what took place between Chunky and
Helena, Bob never disclosed in detail. Ned and
Jerry felt it would be indelicate to do that, and
they never asked much about the matter.</p>

<p>Poor Bob put in a bad quarter of an hour, and
when he left the Schaeffer home his step was not
as buoyant as when he entered. But there was a
look of determination on his face, and he seemed
relieved, as though he had got rid of a weight.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Jerry, as Bob joined his two
chums a little later. “How about you?”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to go and sign up whenever you
are,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Ned, clapping Chunky on
the back with such right good will that the stout
lad almost lost his balance.</p>

<p>“I told you how it would be,” whispered Ned
to Jerry, and the latter nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“Have any trouble?” asked Ned. “I mean
did she break with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not exactly,” answered Bob. “But things
are not as pleasant as they were. It’s her father,
though, not Helena.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we thought,” said Jerry. “Well,
I’m glad it’s over. Now we’ll be three together
once more. Too bad it had to happen, Chunky,
but it’s better to come out and know where you
stand.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the stout lad. “I’m
going to do my duty. Friendship doesn’t count
in this war. It’s duty.”</p>

<p>“You said something!” commented Ned.
“And now to take the step that will put us in the
fight formally for Uncle Sam and against the
Kaiser. We’ll go and volunteer!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been wanting to do right
along,” declared Chunky; “but I didn’t want to
break with Helena if I could help it. She says
she doesn’t see why I have to enlist, why I can’t
wait for the draft, and all that. She says maybe
there won’t be any draft if there’s enough opposition
to it. But I’m going to volunteer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>So the three boys started for Richfield, where
the nearest enlistment station was located.</p>

<p>As they drove down the street their attention
was attracted by a large notice posted on the door
of the auditorium.</p>

<p>“Another patriotic meeting?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Wait until I get out and see what it is,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>He sprang from the car and ran up the steps.
When he came back there was a queer look on his
face.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“A rotten pro-German meeting!” was the
righteously angry answer. “It’s a meeting at
which Mr. Schaeffer is going to preside, and it is
called for the purpose of protesting against any
person being sent to fight outside of the boundaries
of the United States!”</p>

<p>“Do you know, fellows, they oughtn’t to allow
’em to hold that meeting!” exploded Bob, who,
now that he had made his decision, was as enthusiastic
as his chums.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A FIGHT IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry and Bob got out of the automobile to
go up to read the notice for themselves. As Ned
had informed them, a meeting was called, on
whose behalf was not stated, to protest against the
reported action of the military authorities in sending
recruits to do battle on foreign soil.</p>

<p>“We will defend our own country to the last
ditch,” was one of the statements made, “but we
will not send our youth of the land abroad to fight
for foreign kings!”</p>

<p>“Bah, that makes me sick!” declared Jerry.
“What do they want to do? Wait until the foreign
Kaiser comes over here to kill our women
and children before they’re willing to fight?”</p>

<p>“Looks so,” admitted Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t look so long!” announced Jerry.
“I agree with you, Bob, that this meeting ought
not to be held. It’s encouraging sedition. The
military authorities ought to know about it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell Colonel Wentworth!” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll tell him and also let the recruiting
officer in Richfield know about it,” agreed Jerry.
“The military authorities may want to have a
representative present to listen to the talk. If
some of these pro-Germans get too rambunctious
they may get sat on.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to do some of the sitting!” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” offered Chunky.</p>

<p>“And that will be some aid,” laughed Jerry,
as he looked at his stout friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what we’ll do—tell the colonel and
the recruiting officer,” went on Jerry. “I’ve read
about some of these meetings being held in other
places. They are started, financed and encouraged
by German agents here, the same agents that
sent out the warning against sailing on the <i>Lusitania</i>!
The wretches! Boys, this meeting ought
not to be held!” And there were peculiar looks
that passed back and forth among the three chums.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” asked Ned, reminiscently,
as they motored onward, “that the seniors were
going to hold a meeting at Boxwood Hall, once,
and that we broke it up?”</p>

<p>“I should say I do remember!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well—” Ned spoke suggestively.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob’s eyes showed interest.</p>

<p>“Something doing?” he queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better hang around a bit and watch,” advised
his tall chum.</p>

<p>“You get my meaning, I see,” said Ned, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>The recruiting officer at Richfield was both
interested and delighted at the call of the boys.
He was delighted at getting such fine-appearing
recruits, for the motor boys were above the average
in physique, though it could not be denied that
Bob was a bit fat.</p>

<p>“But a few setting up exercises will take that
off you in jig time,” said the recruiting officer.</p>

<p>His interest, too, was keen on getting the information
the boys had to give about the pro-German
meeting.</p>

<p>“So they are starting already, are they?” demanded
Lieutenant Riker. “Well, we’ll have to
expect that. However, they must not go too far—these
pacifists and these lovers of the Kaiser.
Uncle Sam is pretty easy; too easy, I say, but he
has a long arm. I’m much obliged to you boys
for the information. I’ll have one or two regular
men there, just to listen and to report to the
Department of Justice. And as for you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be there!” exclaimed Jerry. “We
wouldn’t miss it. We are going to tell Colonel
Wentworth about it, and he may have something
to suggest.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he did,” commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Lieutenant Riker with a smile. “Well, I’ll leave
that part to you. Now about this enlistment.
It’s fine of you to be among the first to come in.
There’ll be plenty more too, when they find out
a draft is coming.</p>

<p>“Not that it is to the discredit of any one to be
in the selective service, as it is going to be called,”
he went on. “No higher honor can come to a
man. But the advantage of enlisting is that you
can pick your own branch of service, and that will
be of value. Have you boys any idea where you’d
like to be?”</p>

<p>“I’d like aeroplane work,” said Jerry. “We’ve
had experience in that.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of submarines,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not the artillery?” asked Bob. “You
know we had a little to do with explosives when
we went out west to our mine.”</p>

<p>“I see you boys know a little something about
all three branches of the service,” commented the
lieutenant. “Well, perhaps it will be best for you
to volunteer for the infantry at first, and, later,
make application to be transferred. You can do
this as long as you have volunteered.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do,” said Jerry. So, having
formally enlisted, with the consent of their parents,
the boys were told that word would be sent
to them in a few days where to report for preliminary
examinations and training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now we’ll get back and see about that
meeting!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“I shall be interested in the outcome,” said the
recruiting officer.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t be <em>disappointed</em>,” remarked
Jerry, with a smile.</p>

<p>Colonel Wentworth was at once interested and
indignant.</p>

<p>“The idea!” he exclaimed. “What! allowing
a pro-German meeting in Cresville? And especially
when some of her sons are going to be in
the new army! It’s infamous!”</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’d better do something to teach these scoundrels
a lesson!” declared the colonel, who was a
good deal of a “fire-eater,” though no finer patriotic
gentleman lived. “I’ll speak to some of my
friends, and we’ll be at the meeting.”</p>

<p>“We expect to do the same,” said Bob. “We
have some friends, too. We’ll all be there.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” went on the colonel, “every man
is entitled to his own opinion, to a certain extent.
But I don’t believe that when we are at war a
set of men who, for their own advancement came
over here to make money, can, when war is declared
against the country they used to live in,
side with that country and against the land that
has given them everything they have, and has
made them everything they are. There should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
be no more German-Americans! We should all
be Americans. And any meeting or gathering
that tends to foster this divided spirit, any gathering
of misguided individuals which has for an
object the weakening of our righteous war-like
spirit, should be broken up.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll attend to the breaking-up!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Come on, boys! We’ve got
lots to do!”</p>

<p>And for the rest of that day Ned, Bob and
Jerry were very busy.</p>

<p>There was a large gathering at the meeting held
under the auspices of the “Friends of Liberty,” as
they called themselves. Just who the prime
movers were was not certain, but some men, whose
names proclaimed their former nationality, whatever
it might be now, were actively engaged in
making the arrangements. Among them was Mr.
Schaeffer, who was seen hurrying to and fro from
the front entrance to the rooms back of the stage,
where the speakers were sequestered.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, with some of their chums,
were among the early arrivals at the hall. Bob
took a survey over the audience and bowed to
some one.</p>

<p>“Some one else we can get to help when the row
starts?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s Helena,” answered Bob, and he seemed a
trifle uneasy. “Say, boys, what are we going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
do about the women and girls?” he asked. “We
don’t want any of them roughly treated.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any rough treatment,” said
Jerry. “All those who wish, will be given a
chance to leave the hall peaceably first.</p>

<p>“And then the whole thing may fizzle out. It
all depends on the line of talk the speakers hand
out. Lieutenant Riker said we’re not to stand
for anything seditious, or that would tend to discourage
recruiting. It may be that these Kaiserites
will only generalize and not particularize
enough to give us cause for action. We’ve got
to wait. But don’t worry about Helena. She’ll
be all right, whatever happens.”</p>

<p>Bob seemed easier after this, but it was noticed
that his gaze strayed often toward that section of
the hall where Miss Schaeffer sat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her father and two or three other
members of the committee hurried to and fro.
If Mr. Schaeffer saw the boys, he did not speak to
them.</p>

<p>The meeting opened peaceably enough with a
statement by Mr. Schaeffer to the effect that war
was a terrible thing, and something to be avoided
by all peace-loving people, which was the kind
making up the population of the United States.
If other nations wanted to engage in battle, let
them, was his argument. But let them keep
away from those who did not want to fight. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
course, he suggested, there were certain rights
which must be upheld, and on these other speakers
would dwell. He introduced Adolph Pfeiffer as
the principal orator of the evening.</p>

<p>There were a few murmurs as Mr. Schaeffer
sat down, but nothing serious. He had not come
out strongly enough to warrant any open challenge,
though his weak and lack-of-back-bone policy
made some of the audience sneer. Ned, Bob and
Jerry looked over toward several regular soldiers
seated not far from them. They had been sent
by Colonel Riker, but they gave no sign that
there was any need for action yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Pfeiffer was a lawyer, and his name indicated
his leanings. He began by counseling patience
and prudence, and dwelt on the legal aspects
of war, what belligerents had a right to do, and
what was against international law. Then he
spoke of the entrance of the United States into
the war, and he did not challenge the right of the
government to make such a declaration.</p>

<p>“But I do say,” he went on, after a short pause,
“that the United States has no right to send our
boys across the water to fight with the French
and the English against Germany. The United
States has no right to do that!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” some one in the audience demanded.</p>

<p>“Because it is a violation of constitutional rights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
We may defend our land from an invasion, but
Germany is not going to invade us. It is not
right to send our soldiers to fight her.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried Mr. Schaeffer. “This
war is not a good war. We should not go abroad
to fight Germany. Our country is doing wrong
and we should not uphold her when she——”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Treason! Treason!” came the cries from all
over the hall.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<a id="image02">
  <img src="images/image02.jpg" width="382" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_76">“TREASON! TREASON!” CAME THE CRIES FROM ALL OVER
THE HALL.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“I guess it’s time to start something!” exclaimed
Ned, starting to his feet. On one side
of the hall he saw the soldiers rising. On the
other Colonel Wentworth was shaking his fist at
the men on the platform, and shouting something
that could not be heard.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a riot in a minute!” cried Bob, as
he started toward that part of the hall where
Helena Schaeffer had been sitting.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a fight, I guess,” said
Jerry calmly. And then he yelled: “Let the
women and children get out! This is no place
for them!”</p>

<p>There were some frightened screams and
squeals, and a rush on the part of a number of
women to reach the exits. Ushers helped them,
and a quick glance showed Bob that Helena had
gone with them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men on the platform, the German-American
speakers, were holding a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
consultation. Colonel Wentworth was advancing
up the aisle, calling for three cheers for the stars
and stripes, and the singing of the “Star-Spangled
Banner.”</p>

<p>“Quiet! Quiet!” roared Mr. Schaeffer, his
Teutonic accent coming back to him. “Sit down.
You have no right to interrupt this peaceable
meeting, Colonel Wentworth!”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with it! It’s too peaceful—too
traitorous!” cried the former soldier. “I
call on all good Americans to put an end to this
seditious talk!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“We’re with you to the finish!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Put ’em out!” some one called.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand for any seditious talk!” advised
some one beside the colonel.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry kept together. They saw
half a dozen soldiers, regulars from the recruiting
station, walking toward the platform.</p>

<p>Just then some one threw a chair over the heads
of the crowd toward the platform. It broke some
of the electric lights with pops like those of a distant
revolver.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame to stop our speakers!” declared
a man next to Jerry, and his voice was unmistakably
German.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it? Say, what kind of an American
are you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chust as goot vot you are!” came the quick
answer. “I show you dot you can’t——!”</p>

<p>He aimed a blow at Ned, who, to guard himself
quickly raised his arm, and, in so doing, accidentally
struck the German in the face. The
latter let out a roar, and at once began to fling his
arms around like flails.</p>

<p>“Grab him!” cried Jerry to Bob, who was beside
Ned.</p>

<p>In another instant fights started in several parts
of the hall, and there were shouts and yells, some
calling for order and others yelling just from excitement.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a fight!” joyously cried
Jerry. “Stick together, boys!”</p>

<p>An instant later the lights went out, and the
fight, spreading to all parts of the auditorium,
became general in the darkness. There was the
sound of blows, the crashing of chairs, and the
shouts of the enraged ones.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE PARTING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>None of the motor boys had a very clear idea,
during the mêlée or afterward, of what went on.
Jerry said some one hit him several times, and he
hit back. This much was certain because one of
his hands was so bruised that he had to have it
bandaged.</p>

<p>Ned declared he knocked one man down, a man
who spoke with a very pronounced German accent,
until Ned rather spoiled the accent by contriving
to have his fist collide with the mouth of the
person who was muttering something about “<i>Der
Tag</i>.”</p>

<p>“His <em>day</em> came right then and there,” explained
Ned afterward. “Only it was good night for
his.”</p>

<p>As for Bob, he declared that, in the dark, he
was struck on all sides at once.</p>

<p>In the dark no one could tell whom he was hitting.
The fight kept up, the din growing greater
until it was deafening, until a cry for order, led by
several men in concert, came. These men were
the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one managed to light a solitary gas jet in
a corner of the hall, and by the gleam the swaying,
struggling mass could be observed. Fortunately
the women and girls had gotten out, or they might
have been hurt. As it was, they stood outside
and screamed, probably because of fear for their
men relatives inside. Then some one switched
on all the lights, and with that the fight stopped.</p>

<p>There were a few bloody noses, and some eyes
that, in the process of time, would turn black, blue
and other hues, there were torn collars and garments,
while a number of chairs were overturned.</p>

<p>But when Ned, Bob and Jerry looked toward
the stage it was deserted. The chairs that had
been filled with honorary vice-chairmen, were
empty. Mr. Pfeiffer was absent. So was Mr.
Schaeffer. In fact, of all the German-Americans
who had undertaken to conduct the meeting not
one was in sight. They had sneaked off in the
confusion and the darkness. The meeting was
most effectively broken up.</p>

<p>“Well, things came off as we expected,” remarked
Jerry, tying his handkerchief around his
injured hand.</p>

<p>“But not in just the way we had counted on,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>This was true, for the boys had planned that
one of them should call for three cheers for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
flag, and demand that the band play the national
anthem.</p>

<p>It was expected that this would be objected to
by those in charge of the meeting, and then there
would be a good chance to denounce those responsible,
and an opportunity for breaking up the
gathering. This had been Colonel Wentworth’s
plan, but events had shaped themselves differently.
The putting out of the lights had not been planned
by the motor boys.</p>

<p>With the withdrawal of the leading pro-Germans,
their sympathizers in the audience soon went
out, leaving the place well filled with loyal citizens.
Colonel Wentworth, seeing a chance to make a
speech, at once took charge of matters, and organized
a patriotic meeting then and there. This
was turning the tables on the pro-Germans with
a vengeance.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry remained for a while, and
then, as Jerry’s hand was getting painful, the
motor boys left and went to a near-by drug store.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the breaking up of the
pro-German meeting created a stir in the town.
On all sides, save among those who might, because
of their nationality, be expected to differ, there
were heard words of commendation. And when
Ned, Bob and Jerry called on Lieutenant Riker,
to get some final instructions about their enlistment,
the soldier grinned broadly as he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Any more meetings of the ‘Friends of Liberty’
scheduled for your town?”</p>

<p>“Not just at present,” laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>There was some talk, on the part of those who
had called the meeting, of proceeding against
those who had broken it up. Mr. Pfeiffer, the
lawyer, was loudest in this talk.</p>

<p>But he did nothing, and his talk finally ceased
with conspicuous abruptness, probably, as Jerry
remarked, on the advice of more prudent friends.
At the same time there was a noticeable cessation
in the activities of the pro-Germans.</p>

<p>“But I don’t suppose you’ll dare go to call on
Helena now,” said Ned to Bob one day.</p>

<p>“No,” was the somewhat disconsolate answer.
“I don’t believe it would be just the thing.”</p>

<p>“Especially if Mr. Schaeffer were at home,”
observed Jerry.</p>

<p>The breaking up of the meeting had one good
effect. Though a stickler for strict justice might
condemn the method used, there followed, nevertheless,
a stimulation to recruiting. When it became
known that Ned, Bob and Jerry had enlisted
and expected soon to be sent to the nearest
training station, there was a wave of patriotism
in Cresville, and many mothers and fathers were
in despair on account of very young boys who
wanted to join the colors.</p>

<p>It required no little tact to get such off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
notion, but to the credit of the home-folk be it
said that in no case, where a boy was physically
fit, and of the proper age, did he have to hold back
because of the objection of parents.</p>

<p>Those were stirring days, and events moved
swiftly. Once the motor boys had made up their
minds that it was the right thing to enlist, they
were eager to be off to the training camp.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Riker told them they would probably
be sent to a cantonment in one of the Southern
states, which shall be called Camp Dixton, for a
period of training.</p>

<p>“How long will that last?” asked Ned.
“When can we go to France and do some real
fighting?”</p>

<p>“You’ll go as soon as you are fit,” answered the
experienced soldier. “It would be a mistake to
send you abroad now. You would do more harm
than good—I mean raw troops in the aggregate.
You must be trained, and taught how to take care
of yourselves. Why, even the period of training
in how to meet gas attacks alone will take some
time. Don’t be in too much of a hurry. Learn
the business of war and fighting first, and then
you’ll be able to deal the Boche so much harder
blows.”</p>

<p>This was good advice, and the boys, in their
calmer moments, appreciated it; but it was hard
to be inactive. At last the day came when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
were to part from their parents and friends in
Cresville. They did not need to take much with
them, for they would be fitted out in camp.</p>

<p>Up to this time nothing more had been heard
concerning the gold watch and the diamond
brooch lost in the fire, nor had anything more been
learned of the French engraver’s money or of the
mysterious Crooked Nose.</p>

<p>“It’s good-bye to our motor boat and auto and
aeroplane for a while,” said Ned, with a sigh,
as the boys made their way to the station, having
parted with their parents at home.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what we know about running them
may come in handy later,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>On their way to the station they met other boy
friends who had also enlisted, and as they reached
the depot they saw a crowd there to give them a
send-off.</p>

<p>“And look who’s here to kiss little Bob good-bye!”
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Chunky.</p>

<p>“Miss Helena Schaeffer,” was the answer.
“Oh, Bob! Oh, boy! Go to it!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>OFF TO CAMP DIXTON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Bob Baker did not flinch in what might be
called the “face of the enemy.”</p>

<p>True, Helena was not exactly an enemy, though
her father had helped to organize the pro-German
meeting. But Helena was a girl who, in a
measure, thought for herself. She did not altogether
agree with the opinions held by her father
and his Fatherland friends, though she had heard
many stories of the achievements of the Kaiser
and his chosen ones. Also she had heard, not
from her father, other stories that reflected anything
but glory on German arms.</p>

<p>And so, when Helena knew that the motor boys
were about to take the train that, eventually,
would land them at Camp Dixton, she decided to
go to say good-bye to Bob Baker.</p>

<p>Naturally, she did not tell her father of her
intention, and, naturally, Mr. Schaeffer was as
far as possible from the station from which the
recruits departed. He did not care to see such
activities on the part of loyal Cresvillians in favor
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a violation of the constitutional rights of
the young men to be placed in a position where
they might have to fight on foreign soil, Mr.
Schaeffer claimed. Mr. Pfeiffer had said so and
he ought to know.</p>

<p>“Well, Helena, I am glad to see you,” remarked
Bob, when he found himself near the
blue-eyed girl.</p>

<p>“Are you?” she inquired, and her voice was not
very warm.</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” he insisted. “It’s no end
good of you to come down to see me off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I’d come,” she said, a bit
shyly. “I—I’m sorry we had that little difference
of opinion. But you know—you know, I’ve
always liked you, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Helena.”</p>

<p>“But you know war is a terrible thing!”</p>

<p>“Are you sorry to see me go?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am! I’m afraid you won’t come
back.” And for the first time she showed a little
emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come back all right!” declared Bob,
as he took her hand.</p>

<p>“Let go!” she exclaimed. “Some one will see
us!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” declared the stout one. “I like
you a lot, Helena, and I’m sorry your father——”</p>

<p>“Please don’t speak of him!” she begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
quickly. “I must do as my father says, and,
though I like you, I—I—that is, he says—well,
he doesn’t believe in this war!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’ll have to come to believe in
it,” said Bob. “We all will. It’s a war that’s
got to be fought to a finish. I’m sorry for the
peace-loving Germans, if there are any, who don’t
hold with the Kaiser, but I’m against all who do!
We’re in this war to win, Helena!”</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. She seemed struggling
with some emotion. The distant whistle of
a train was heard, and the recruits, some of whom
formed the centers of rather tearful groups, prepared
to gather up their luggage.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s good-bye, Helena,” said Bob,
while Ned and Jerry were bidding farewell to
some boy and girl friends, among them Mollie
Horton and Alice Vines.</p>

<p>“Yes, good-bye,” Helena murmured. “I’m
sorry you’re going, but I suppose you know your
own business best. Perhaps you will not be gone
for as long as you think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it will be for a long time,” said
Bob. “This war isn’t going to be over in a hurry.
But we’ve all got to do our duty.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s too bad we can’t all have the same
duty,” sighed Helena. “However, I suppose that
can never be. Good-bye, Bob. Write to me
when you get a chance!” and before Bob knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
what was happening she had given him a rather
sisterly kiss on his forehead and disappeared in
the crowd.</p>

<p>“Here! Wait a minute!” called Bob, starting
after her. But the train came in just then and
there was so much confusion, and such a scramble
to get baggage together and find places in the
cars, that Bob did not get another glimpse of
Helena.</p>

<p>A United States regular, Sergeant Mandell,
was in charge of the recruits, having been detailed
by Lieutenant Riker to conduct them safely to
Camp Dixton.</p>

<p>“All aboard, boys!” he called. “All aboard!”</p>

<p>“All aboard she is!” echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’re off for the camp!” said Ned.</p>

<p>Bob said nothing, but as soon as he got in his
seat he raised the window and looked out.
Helena was not in sight, and, with a sigh, the
stout lad turned away.</p>

<p>A special car had been reserved for the boys
from Cresville and vicinity, who were going away
in a body, and the lads now filled the coach with
gay songs and jests. To most of them it was a
holiday, a picnic, but there were some who felt
the gravity of the situation, and who felt that
doing their duty in the matter of enlisting was not
as easy as it seemed.</p>

<p>The three motor boys kept together, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had stowed away their possessions and made themselves
comfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, this is the first time we ever left Cresville
under such circumstances,” observed Ned, as
the train pulled out of the station amid cheers
from those left behind, and a stirring air played
by the band.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve gone out on many a trip, but none
was just like this,” agreed Jerry. “I wish the
professor could be with us, at least part of the
way. He’d be interested in this bunch.”</p>

<p>“More likely he’d be crawling around on the
floor of the car looking for a new kind of fly,” said
Bob, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had gone back to Boston
after his flying visit to Cresville. But he had
promised to go to see them in camp, for it was
evident that, on account of the war, he would not
be kept very busy at Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>Soon the prospective soldiers in the special car
were having the best of times. They had gotten
over the first wrench of parting, and were having
fun. They sang and joked, and Ned, Bob and
Jerry entered into the jollity of the occasion.</p>

<p>“Do we go right into camp?” asked one lad
from Cresville.</p>

<p>“No, I believe we first have to stop at Yorktown
and go through a detailed examination,” answered
Jerry, who had been making inquiries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“So far all we’ve gone through has been preliminary;
and though we have enlisted, there is still
a lot of red tape to go through. They’ll sift us
out at Yorktown.”</p>

<p>“You mean separate the sheep from the goats!”
laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Something like that, yes,” Jerry admitted.</p>

<p>So they traveled on. At each stop there was a
rush to get papers, if any were available, so the
recruits might know the latest news in regard to
the war. There were flaming headlines, but not
much real news, as events were, as yet, hardly
shaped. But everything went to show that Uncle
Sam had at last decided to get into the war on a
wholesale scale.</p>

<p>“When’s the next stop?” asked Bob, as the
conductor came through on one of his trips.</p>

<p>“Oh, in about half an hour. But that isn’t
Yorktown.”</p>

<p>“No, I know it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Chunky wants to know if there’s a lunch
counter there,” put in Ned, grinning.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sort of one;” and the conductor
smiled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>PUG KENNEDY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Say, look here!” blustered Bob, when the conductor
had passed on. “Just because I ask about
the next station doesn’t mean that I want to eat
<em>all</em> the while.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t eating <em>all</em> the while,” said Ned.
“This is only the second in a while since we
started.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hungry!” declared the stout lad.
“Maybe you are, too, only you’re too proud to
admit it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” declared Jerry. “Chunky, I second
your motion, and I wish my jaws were in motion
right now. I’ll be with you when the crullers
nest again!” he chanted.</p>

<p>“Who said pie?” demanded a voice at the end
of the car.</p>

<p>“That bunch up in the middle,” answered another,
indicating the motor boys.</p>

<p>“Is there any chance for a feed?” came a
veritable howl from some hungry lad. “Tell me,
oh, tell me, I implore!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Next stop,” answered Jerry. “That is,” and
he turned to the sergeant in charge, “unless you
have some rations concealed somewhere about
your person,” and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Not a ration,” was the answer. “I suppose
there ought to have been some arrangement made
for feeding you boys on the way, but there is such
a rush that it has been overlooked. However,
if you are short of change——”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got the <em>money</em>! All we want is
<em>time</em> to eat!” came the cry.</p>

<p>“I’ll see to that, then,” said Sergeant Mandell.
“If necessary I’ll have the conductor hold the
train for a minute or two, until you can raid the
lunch counter. But mind! everything must be
paid for, as I am responsible.”</p>

<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry, by common consent, were
detailed into a foraging party on behalf of some
of their comrades and a common fund was made
up with which to purchase what food could be
found. Then the boys eagerly waited for the
train to arrive at the station where there was a
lunch counter.</p>

<p>And such a rush as there was when the place
was announced! The three motor boys, as
treasurers, were accompanied to the counter by
a mob of the boys who for themselves or for
companions had orders for everything in sight.</p>

<p>“I want apple pie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cherry for mine!”</p>

<p>“Give me peach!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the ‘peachy’ girl behind
the counter?” asked some one, and there
were many glances of warm but respectful admiration
cast at the young girl behind the piles of food
on the marble shelf.</p>

<p>“Sandwiches—all you got!” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“And some crullers, if you haven’t enough pie!”
added Bob. “I want a <em>lot</em> of crullers. You can
put ’em in your pocket!” he confided to Ned.</p>

<p>“Put ’em in your pocket? Man, dear! I’m going
to put <em>mine</em> in my <em>stomach</em>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. So’m I—most of ’em,” went
on Chunky. “But you can stow away some in
your pockets to eat when you get hungry again.
They don’t get as mushy as pie.”</p>

<p>“You’re the limit!” Ned told his chum. “You
haven’t had a feed yet, and you’re thinking of
the next one. But go to it! I never felt so hungry
in my life.” So Bob went to it, to the extent
of stuffing his pockets with crullers, and carrying
away as much else as he could in his hands.</p>

<p>The girl at the lunch counter would have been
swamped, but Jerry organized a sort of helping
corps, and dealt out the food to his fellow recruits,
making payment in due course, until the counter
looked as fields do after a visit from the locusts.</p>

<p>Back to the car, only just in time, rushed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
boys, bearing things to eat to those of their comrades
who had remained in their seats, for some
were detailed to remain as a sort of guard over
the luggage.</p>

<p>“Ah! This is something like!” exclaimed Bob,
as he sat in his seat when the train had again
started, holding a sandwich in each hand, while
his pockets bulged suspiciously.</p>

<p>“You seem pretty well provided for,” remarked
Ned to his stout chum, as the three motor boys
sat together again.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t aim to starve if I can help it,”
retorted Bob, as he munched away.</p>

<p>“You must weigh five or six pounds more,”
added Jerry, with a glance at Bob’s pockets.
“That’s dangerous business, old man!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bob, pausing half-way to a bite
of his sandwich.</p>

<p>“Putting on weight like that. You must remember
that you’re not more than just tall enough
to break in under the military requirements, and
if you are too heavy for your height—out you go.”</p>

<p>“You can’t take away my appetite!” exclaimed
Bob, but he did not see Ned wink at Jerry and
motion with his head toward the bulging pockets
of the stout lad.</p>

<p>For a time there was a merry scene in the car,
where the prospective soldiers were riding. Hungry
appetites were being appeased, and this caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a line of small talk, which had rather died away
after the first part of the journey.</p>

<p>Many of the lads were friends, and a number
knew the motor boys, having lived in Cresville.
Others were from surrounding towns, and some
of them Ned, Bob, and Jerry knew, or had heard
about. Others were total strangers, and one or
two seemed quite alone. These had come from
small villages, where not more than one or two
had volunteered. One such lad, who gave his
name as Harry Blake, the motor boys made
friends with, and shared their food with him, as
he had not seen fit, for some reason or other, to
get off and provide himself.</p>

<p>“Have you any particular branch of the service
in view?” asked Jerry of Harry, as he saw Ned
and Bob jointly looking at a paper.</p>

<p>“I did hope to get in the aviation corps, but
they tell me it’s pretty hard.”</p>

<p>“Hard to get in?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, and hard to learn the rudiments of
the game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, that isn’t exactly so,” Jerry answered.
“Of course I don’t know much about military
aeroplanes, but my friends and I have been operating
airships for some time. It’s comparatively
easy, once you get over the natural fear. Though
of course becoming an expert is another matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I think you could soon learn. You look as though
you were cool-headed.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t get excited easily, but I don’t know
beans about an airship. I’ve read a little; but
the more I read the more I get confused. I’d
like to understand the principle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help you,” Jerry said. “I’ve
got a book here on aeroplanes, and my friends
and I have helped build some. I can give you a
little book-knowledge for a starter.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” pleaded Harry, and then
he and Jerry plunged into a subject that interested
them both.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train rushed on, carrying the
recruits nearer to the training camp, or rather,
to the city where they would be given a more
careful examination and separated into units, to
be divided among the various cantonments where
Uncle Sam was getting his new armies ready to
face the Kaiser’s veterans.</p>

<p>Jerry had just finished telling Harry something
about the way in which the double rudders controlled
an airship—one guiding it up or down, and
the other to left or right, when there came a howl
from Bob—a veritable wail of anguish.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, who had
moved out of the seat beside his stout chum, and
was sitting back of him. “Did you bite your
tongue?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bite my tongue? Come on! You know better
than that. Hand ’em over!” and Bob, extending
his fist, shook it under Ned’s nose.</p>

<p>“Hand what over? What do you mean? If
you mean these magazines, I’ve just started ’em.
Besides, they’re mine!”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean the magazines, and you
know it!” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I don’t know what you do
mean. What’s the row, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“My crullers!” exclaimed Bob. “You snitched
’em out of my pocket when you were sitting in
the same seat with me. Come on; a joke’s a joke,
and I don’t mind if you keep one for yourself,
and another for Jerry. But hand over the rest!”</p>

<p>“The rest of what?” asked Ned, innocently
enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, quit! You know! My crullers. I
bought ’em to eat when I got hungry, and now
they’re gone,” and in proof Bob stood up and
turned both coat pockets inside out.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see they’re empty,” observed Ned
coolly. “But I haven’t got ’em!”</p>

<p>“You have so!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I haven’t. Search me!” and Ned,
with an air of injured innocence, stood up and extended
his arms at either side, an invitation for
Bob to feel in his pockets. It was an invitation
which the stout youth did not ignore, and he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
about Ned’s clothes with thoroughness, and convinced
himself that the crullers were, as Ned had
declared, not on his person.</p>

<p>“Well, you know where they are!” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Jerry does, then!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the tall lad, looking up
from his book on aeroplanes, which he and his
new acquaintance were going over.</p>

<p>Bob explained, and Jerry’s denial was such
that the stout lad felt inclined to accept it as final.
Especially as he remembered that Jerry had not
been near him since the purchase of the food at
the lunch counter.</p>

<p>“Well, somebody’s got my crullers and I’m going
to get ’em back!” exclaimed Bob. “I paid for
’em and I want ’em. A joke’s a joke, but this is
too much! Shell out, fellows!” and he looked
around at those nearest him.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that Ned had
slyly slipped the bags of crullers out of the two
side pockets of Bob’s coat, and had passed them,
surreptitiously to two fellow conspirators. And
then, as is usual in such cases, the crullers had
gone from hand to hand until, reaching the far
end of the car, they had been quickly eaten.</p>

<p>But Bob did not give up. Satisfied that Ned
did not have the pastry on his person, Bob set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
about a search for it. He walked down the aisle,
looking in various seats, and poking his fingers in
the pockets of those he knew, until he came to the
end of the car.</p>

<p>In one of the seats sat a heavily-built youth,
whose face was not of a prepossessing type. He
had a sort of bulldog air about him, as though
“spoiling for a fight,” and he had had little to say
to the other recruits.</p>

<p>Bob, looking at the coat of this lad, as the
garment was spread out over the unoccupied half
of a seat, made a grab for something in one of
the pockets, at the same time crying:</p>

<p>“Here they are! I knew you’d snitched ’em!”
and he pulled out a bag, and drew therefrom a
cruller.</p>

<p>The lad in the seat turned quickly from looking
out the window, and, without a moment’s hesitation,
sent his fist into Bob’s face.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’ll teach you to let Pug Kennedy’s
things alone!” he growled.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>IN THE CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Bob, surprised as much by the suddenness of
the other’s action as by the violence of the blow,
staggered back, his hands going to his bruised
face. There was a moment of silence, and then
Jerry, who had seen the whole occurrence, cried
out in ringing tones:</p>

<p>“Here, fellow, don’t you hit him again!”</p>

<p>“Who says so?” demanded “Pug” Kennedy, as
he called himself. “If you’re looking for trouble
come down and get yours!” and he stepped out
into the aisle and struck a characteristic pugilistic
attitude.</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for trouble,” said Jerry
calmly; “but I like fair play, and I’m going to see
that my friend gets it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re going to butt in, are you?” sneered
the other.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not in the habit of doing that,” said
Jerry. “But what did you strike Bob for?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is our business, too,” said Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
walking up beside Jerry. Bob’s nose had begun
to bleed and he was holding his handkerchief to
it. He seemed dazed, and acted as though he did
not know how to account for what had occurred.</p>

<p>“What happened, Bob?” asked Jerry, as Ned
walked up to the heavily-built lad.</p>

<p>“Why, I was looking for my bag of crullers,
and I saw them in his pocket and——”</p>

<p>“You did not!” burst out Pug Kennedy.
“That’s my own grub that I bought in the station,
and if you want to fight for it——”</p>

<p>“What are you always talking about fighting
for?” asked Ned suddenly, as he put out his hand
and swung the bully around sharply. “I guess
you aren’t the only one who can do that.”</p>

<p>“Keep your hands off me!” roared Pug Kennedy.
“If you’re looking for trouble——”</p>

<p>“I generally find what I’m looking for,” said
Ned softly, and he did not give back an inch as
Kennedy took a quick step forward.</p>

<p>Then, with a quickness that showed he understood
considerable about the pugilistic ring,
Kennedy made a sudden shift, and his fist shot out
toward Ned. But the latter was just as quick,
and, dodging the blow, he put out his hand in a
stiff arm movement and pushed Kennedy back
into his seat. The bully fell heavily. He tried
to get up.</p>

<p>“No you don’t! Just sit there awhile!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Ned, and he plumped himself down on the struggling
one, holding him in place.</p>

<p>Seeing how matters were going, the others who
had crowded up drew back as well as they could
in the aisle of the swaying car, to give room to the
struggling ones. If there was to be a fight it was
no more than right that it should be a fair one.</p>

<p>“Let me up!” spluttered Pug Kennedy.</p>

<p>“Not until I get ready,” answered Ned coolly.</p>

<p>He could afford to be cool. For he had dodged
what Pug had thought was going to be a “knockout
blow” in such a clever way that the bully was
disconcerted, and now Kennedy was held down in
such a position that he could not use his strength
to advantage.</p>

<p>But he was strong, Ned had to admit that.
Only because of the fact that he had the larger
boy at a disadvantage, sitting on him, so to speak,
and holding him down by bracing his legs against
the opposite seat, was Ned able to keep himself
where he was, for Pug struggled hard.</p>

<p>“Just stay there until you cool off a bit,” advised
Ned, “and until you learn not to hit out so
with your fists. If you want to fight, we’ll find
some one your size and weight in our crowd to
take you on. How about it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I’ll agree if he will,” was the answer, and the
tall lad grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Who said I wanted to fight?” growled Pug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Kennedy, as he saw several unfriendly looks cast
in his direction, and noted the athletic build of
Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Well, you sort of acted that way,” commented
Ned, who did not intend to give the bully the
slightest advantage. “What did you want to hit
Bob for?” and he nodded at his chum, who had
finally succeeded in stopping his nose hemorrhage.</p>

<p>“What’d he want to go and shove his hands
into my pocket for, without asking me if he
could?” demanded Pug, and it must be admitted
that he really had right on his side. Bob had
acted hastily, and perhaps indiscreetly, considering
that he did not know the lad who had had the
encounter with him.</p>

<p>“I was only looking for my crullers,” Bob explained.
“Some one took ’em for a joke, and
when I saw the bag in your pocket I thought you
had ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you say so?” growled Pug,
who, in truth, looked something like the animal
from which had come the nickname.</p>

<p>“You didn’t give me a chance,” said Bob. “If
you wanted to fight why didn’t you say so?”</p>

<p>“Well, you mind your own business, and let me
alone!” growled the belligerent one. “And you’d
better let me up if you know what’s good for
you!” he added fiercely to Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I know my business,” was the calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
rejoinder. “At the same time I’m willing to let
you up provided you promise to keep your hands
off my friend. If you want to fight, as I said, that
can be arranged.”</p>

<p>“I won’t promise anything!” growled Pug.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll sit there until you do,” observed
Ned. There is no telling how long this deadlock
might have kept up, but at this point Sergeant
Mandell, who had been in the smoking car, came
back to see how his recruits were getting on. He
took in the scene at a glance.</p>

<p>“Let him up, Slade,” he ordered Ned. “And
you, Kennedy, keep quiet. Remember you’re soldiers
now, and you must obey your superiors.
For the time being I am your officer, though I
want to be your friend, too. Now what’s the
row?”</p>

<p>It was explained in various ways, but all agreed
that Kennedy had struck first, and with little
provocation, for Bob’s action, though thoughtless,
poking his hands into the pockets of another lad,
had been innocent enough.</p>

<p>“You had no right to hit him for that,” declared
the sergeant. “But I am not saying that
Baker did exactly right, either. Though it was
natural for him to want his crullers.”</p>

<p>With mutterings and growls, Pug Kennedy
shook himself after Ned let him up, and slunk
into his seat, away from the others. Ned, Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and Jerry went back to their places, and quiet was
once more restored.</p>

<p>“Bob, old man, I’m sorry,” said Ned. “It was
my fault. I did take your crullers, but I haven’t
’em now. I passed ’em down the line as a joke.
I’ll see if I can get ’em back.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em go, I don’t want ’em,” growled Bob.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a good thing he did not want
them, since the crullers had been eaten. When
Ned learned that he offered to buy some more at
the next lunch counter.</p>

<p>But there was no time for this, as Sergeant
Mandell said they would soon reach Yorktown,
where they would be quartered until they could
be more carefully examined and a decision arrived
at as to where to send them for preliminary
training.</p>

<p>As the motor boys, with their old and new
friends, were gathering up their luggage, preparatory
to getting off the train when it should stop in
Yorktown, a lad slipped up to Ned.</p>

<p>“You want to look out for that fellow,” he
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What fellow?”</p>

<p>“That Pug Kennedy. The one you sat on.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a scrapper and always looking for a
fight. He comes from the same town I do, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
he’s licked every boy in it, some bigger than he
is, too.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for telling me,” said Ned. “I’m not
afraid of him. But, just the same, it’s as well to
be on the watch. He seems like a bully.”</p>

<p>“He is. He doesn’t mind fighting a fellow
smaller than himself. I don’t like him, but I’ve
got to hand it to him—he is some scrapper! I
hope the army takes some of the mean wrinkles
out of him.”</p>

<p>“The army is just the place to get it done,” observed
Ned. “Thanks for telling me. See you
again some time.”</p>

<p>He looked over to note what Kennedy was doing,
but the latter had left the car. Ned, Bob,
and Jerry, with their fellow recruits, were formed
into a squad, and, amid the friendly looks of a
crowd that gathered at the station, they marched
to the barracks, which were not far away.</p>

<p>“So Pug Kennedy is a scrapper, is he?” observed
Jerry, when Ned told him the result of the
talk with the other boy. “Well, it’s as well to
know that first as last. I hope he isn’t sent to
our camp. But, if he is, we’ll have to make the
best of it.”</p>

<p>It was noted that “Pug” answered to the title
of Michael, and it was assumed that “Pug” had
been the characterization given him because of his
fancied resemblance to a dog of that breed—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
resemblance more real, in certain ways, than
fancied.</p>

<p>In the following days the recruits were measured,
weighed, tested in various ways, and finally
were all sworn in as privates in the United States
army that was eventually to fight, in France or
elsewhere, the troops of the Central Powers.</p>

<p>To Bob’s distress he was held up by one doctor,
as being overweight, and was close to being rejected.
But his chums took him in hand, and for
a day starved him on a most reduced diet, and
made him take so much exercise that Bob lost
about five pounds, and passed.</p>

<p>“But it was a close call,” said Jerry, when all
was safe. “Don’t go to stuffing yourself with
pie or crullers until after you’re in the camp.
Then they won’t put you out, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Bob, now quite anxious.</p>

<p>And, three days later, the motor boys, with a
number of their friends from Cresville, and with
others whom they did not know, including the unpleasant
Pug Kennedy, were sent to Camp Dixton,
there to be given a thorough training for their new
life in the army.</p>

<small>SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Out of the gray, chilly, and silent dawn
came the sharp notes of a bugle. The sound
echoed among the mist-enshrouded hills, the notes
vibrating in and out among the trees, and then
seemed to die away in the distance.</p>

<p>But if any one of the several thousand prospective
soldiers, sleeping the sleep of the more or
less just in the tents of Camp Dixton, thought it
was but a dream, those notes of the bugle, he was
sadly, if not rudely, awakened when the sound
came with greater insistence, as if calling over
and over again:</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up! You must get up!”</p>

<p>“I say, Ned!” lazily called Bob from his bed
amid the blankets on the ground under a khaki
tent, “what day is it?”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make?” asked Ned.
“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know without asking, when you
hear that <em>horn</em>,” grunted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Horn? Bugle you mean,” came a voice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the other corner of the tent, if a conical tent, the
shape used in the army, can be said to have “corners.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” assented Jerry. “I’m
anxious to know what Bob meant by asking what
day it was.”</p>

<p>“If it’s only Sunday we’ll get a chance to rest,”
explained the stout Chunky, peering out from under
his blankets. For he and the others had
wrapped up well, as the night had been chilly.</p>

<p>“Chance to rest!” exclaimed Ned. “Say, we
haven’t <em>done</em> anything yet.”</p>

<p>“Done anything!” challenged Bob. “Don’t
you call that drill we went through yesterday anything?”</p>

<p>“Just a little setting up exercise, and some
marching to get you to know your hay foot from
your straw foot,” commented the tall lad. “If
you’re going to kick about that the second day in
camp what will happen in about a week?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not kicking,” hastily said Bob. “In
fact, I’m too lame and sore to kick. And my
arm feels like a boil.”</p>

<p>“Anti-typhus germs,” explained Ned. “You’ll
be a whole lot worse before you’re better. We
have to have two more injections, I understand.”</p>

<p>The rousing notes of the bugle, “rousing” in
a double sense, again sounded, and, not without
considerable grumbling and growling, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
even Jerry, by the look on his face at least, seemed
to join, the boys got up and prepared for another
day in camp—their second.</p>

<p>The young volunteers, with a lot of other recruits,
had reached the camp ground the day before,
but there was so much confusion, so many
new arrivals, and such a general air of orderly
disorder about the place, that the impressions Ned,
Bob, and Jerry received were mixed.</p>

<p>Camp Dixton was situated in one of the Southern
states, and was laid out on a big plain at the
foot of some hills, which, as they rose farther to
the west, became sizable mountains. The plain
which had, until within a short time of the laying
out of the cantonments, been several large farms,
consisted of level ground, with a few places where
there were low rounded hills and patches of wood.
It was an ideal location for a camp, giving opportunity
for drills and sham battles over as great a
diversity of terrain as might be found in Flanders
or France.</p>

<p>As to the camp itself, it was typical of many
that have since sprung up all over the United
States to care for the large army, or armies, that
are constantly being raised. And the building of
Camp Dixton, like the making of all the others,
had been little short of marvelous. On what had
been, a few months before, a series of farms, there
was now a military city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The place was laid out like a model city. The
barracks for the soldiers were, of course, made of
rough wood, and few of them were painted, but
there was time enough for that. A great level,
center space had been set aside as a parade ground,
and in the midst of this was the division headquarters.
North and south of the parade ground
were the long rows of “streets” lined with the
wooden buildings, some of which were sleeping
quarters, some cook houses and others places
where the officers lived.</p>

<p>There were long rows of warehouses, into
which ran railroad sidings; there were an ice
house, an ice plant, a big laundry, a theater, and
many other buildings and establishments such as
one would find in a city.</p>

<p>As for the military units themselves, there were
infantry, cavalry, machine gun companies, artillery
companies, a motor corp and even a small contingent
of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>On their arrival the day before, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry, with the other recruits, had been met at the
railroad station by a number of officers, who
looked very spick and span in their olive-drab
uniforms, with their brown leather leggings polished
until one could almost see his face in them.</p>

<p>In columns of four abreast, carrying their handbags
and suitcases, the new soldiers were marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
up to camp, a most unmilitary looking lot, as the
boys themselves admitted.</p>

<p>A few at a time, the lads were ushered into
booths, where officers took their names, records,
and other details, then they were given something
to eat.</p>

<p>“For all the world like a sort of picnic in a new
mining town,” as Ned wrote home.</p>

<p>Then had come a preliminary drill, and some
setting-up exercises. The boys were so tired out
from this, and from their journey, that no one
thought of anything but bed when it was over.</p>

<p>“And now we’ve got to do it all over again,”
murmured Bob, as he began to dress. “This is
somewhat different from what we were used to at
home. Home was never like this!”</p>

<p>“Quit your kicking!” exclaimed Jerry. “Aren’t
you glad you’re in this, and are going to help lick
the Huns?”</p>

<p>“Sure I am!” declared the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Then keep still about it!”</p>

<p>“Say, I’ve got a right to kick if I want to, as
long as I get up when the bugle calls,” declared
Bob. “It’s the constitutional right of a free-born
American citizen to kick, and I’m doing it!”</p>

<p>“Showing you how much like the mule an otherwise
perfectly good fellow can become,” murmured
Ned, and then he had to duck to get out of
the way of a shoe that Bob tossed at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! Hustle!” called a non-commissioned
officer, thrusting his head in the doorway
of the tent where the boys were dressing.
“Roll call soon!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be there,” announced Ned. “I hope we
get shifted to one of the barracks to-day,” he
went on. “It’s a bit damp in this tent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a wooden shack will be better,” agreed
Jerry.</p>

<p>Most of the new arrivals were in the wooden
buildings, but in the hurry and confusion of the
day before, some had to be assigned temporarily
to tents. New barracks were in the course of
construction, however, to accommodate the constantly
growing number of volunteers. Later the
great camps would be filled with the men of the
draft.</p>

<p>When Ned had finished his hasty dressing, he
strolled over to look at the posted notice in the
tent, which gave a list of the day’s duties and the
hours for drills. The bulletin was headed “Service
Roll Calls.”</p>

<p>The first thing in the order of the day is reveille,
but this is preceded by what is known as “First
call.” This is sounded at 5:45 in the morning,
rather an early hour, as almost any one but a
milkman will concede. But one gets used to it,
as Bob said later.</p>

<p>“First call” is a series of stirring notes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bugle which has for its purpose the awakening of
the buglers themselves, to get them out of their
snug beds to give the reveille proper. March and
reveille come ten minutes later, the buglers marching
up and down the streets in front of the tents
and barracks, and “blowing their heads off,” to
quote Jerry Hopkins. This is calculated to
awaken each and every rookie, but if it fails the
various squad leaders see to it that no one is
missed.</p>

<p>“Assembly,” is the call which comes at six
o’clock, and then woe betide the recruit who is not
dressed and in line, standing at attention. As can
be seen, there is but five minutes allowed for dressing;
that is, if a man does not awaken until the
reveille sounds. If he opens his eyes at first call,
and gets up then, he has fifteen minutes to primp,
though this is generally saved for dress parade.
Roll call follows the assembly.</p>

<p>On this morning, when it had been ascertained
that all were “present or accounted for,” Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, with their new comrades, were
dismissed to wash for breakfast. With soap and
towels there was a general rush for the wash
room, and then followed a healthful splashing.</p>

<p>“It isn’t like our bathroom at home,” said Bob,
as he polished his face, “but I suppose the results
are the same.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Ned. “They have showers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
here, and that’s more than they have in some
camps, yet, I hear.”</p>

<p>“We’ll need a shower after drill,” declared
Jerry. “It’s going to be hot and dry to-day.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was the next call, only it was not
called that. It was down on the schedule as
“mess,” and so every meal was designated though,
of course, in their own minds, each recruit thought
of the first meal as breakfast, the second as dinner,
and the third as supper. But to the army
cook each meal was a “mess.”</p>

<p>But before breakfast the boys had to make up
their beds. They had been given a lesson in that
the previous day. Soon after their arrival the
recruits were divided into squads, and under the
guidance of a squad leader they were taken to a
big pile of straw and told to fill the heavy, white
cotton bags that were to serve in the place of mattresses.
There was a hole in the middle of the
bag, and through this the straw was poked, and
the whole made as smooth as possible on the
bunks.</p>

<p>After their first night, Ned, Bob, and Jerry
were transferred to a wooden barracks. When
they carried the straw mattresses to this building,
they found that each squad room contained about
fifty bunks arranged around the walls, with two
rows down the middle. On each bunk, besides
the mattress, or “bedsack,” as it is officially called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were a pillow and three blankets. These must be
neatly arranged after the night’s sleep. Beds in
a military camp are not made up until just before
they are used, but during the day the blankets must
be neatly folded, laid on the bunks and the pillow
placed on top of the blankets.</p>

<p>There were no clothes closets, and the only
place Ned, Bob and Jerry had to put their things
was on a shelf back of each lad’s bunk, and on
some nails, driven into the wall near by. On these
were all the possessions they were allowed, and,
as can be imagined, they were not many—or would
not be, once the boys were in uniform.</p>

<p>As yet, none of the new recruits wore a uniform.
All were dressed just as they had come from their
homes, and there was the usual variety seen at any
baseball game.</p>

<p>“Mess call!” sang out Jerry, as he and his
chums heard the notes of the bugles again. This
time the call seemed to the boys to be more cheerful.</p>

<p>“I hope they have something good for breakfast,”
murmured Bob, and this time his chums did
not laugh at him. They were as hungry as he
was.</p>

<p>“Um! Oh! Smell that!” cried Bob, as he
hurried out in answer to the first mess call of the
day. “Bacon, or I’m a sinner!”</p>

<p>Breakfast call was sounded at 6:15 and half
an hour was allowed for it.</p>

<p>As soon as the mess call had sounded each man,
acting under the directions of his squad leader,
got his mess kit, consisting of plate, cup, knife,
fork and spoon. Later the boys needed no instructions
in producing these implements of “warfare.”</p>

<p>The signal being given, they marched to the
kitchen where there was dished out to each one
what was to be the first meal of the day. This
proved to be steamed rice and milk, bacon, scrambled
eggs, fried potatoes, buttered toast, bread
and coffee.</p>

<p>With this as a starter the boys marched into
the mess hall and sat down at long tables to eat.</p>

<p>“How goes it, Chunky?” asked Ned, as he
noticed his stout chum beginning to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell you better when I’ve had my second or
third helping,” was the somewhat mumbled reply.</p>

<p>“Talk it out, Chunky,” advised Jerry. “Don’t
scramble your reply; leave that to the eggs you’re
sailing into.”</p>

<p>“Huh, I’ll sail clear through these, and then
some.”</p>

<p>“Can you have as much as you like?” asked a
rather timid lad next to Ned.</p>

<p>“All you want, son, and more,” answered the
squad leader, who was walking about, and who
had overheard the question.</p>

<p>As each one finished he took his mess kit down
to the end of the hall, where there was a kettle
of scalding water, and washed his cutlery and
dishes. There are no official dishwashers in the
army, save those who serve in the officer’s mess.</p>

<p>“Well, do you feel better?” asked Ned, as he
and Jerry filed out with Bob.</p>

<p>“Lots,” was the answer. “What call’s that?”
he inquired, as another bugle note blared out.</p>

<p>“Sick call and fatigue,” answered Jerry, who
was learning the army orders and regulations.</p>

<p>This call came at 6:45 and gave opportunity
for such as were physically disabled in any way
to escape drill for the day. If a man is not feeling
physically fit in the morning he so reports to
his first sergeant, who places the name on a list.
Then, when the proper call comes, and all who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in need of medical attention are collected, an
officer marches them to an infirmary.</p>

<p>Of course, this applies only to those slightly
“under the weather.” In case of a very ill recruit
the doctor goes to him, instead of having
him go to the medical man. If a man is taken
ill, or feels the need of medical attention at any
time other than the official sick call, an officer is
detailed to take him to the doctor, or the doctor
comes to him, at any hour it may be necessary.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were very few who responded
to sick call the first morning in Camp Dixton.
When it was over, at 6:50 o’clock, came the first
call for the day’s drill. Five minutes later came
the assembly, which meant that every man, not
excused, must be in line. Then the drill began.
It was to last an hour.</p>

<p>There were six drills during the day (or were
at Camp Dixton), besides guard-mount in the late
afternoon. Between the drills came dinner, of
course. But the new soldiers were impressed with
the drills. There were so many of them, and
when there was no drill there was a school of
instruction.</p>

<p>Drills, or the assembly calls for them, came at
the following hours: 8:15, 9:30, 10:45, 1:00, and
2:15. At 3:30 came a school of instruction,
which lasted an hour. There was guard-mount,
too, which is another sort of drill, at 5:00. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
lasted half an hour, and mess call for supper
sounded shortly after 5:30, followed by retreat,
meaning that the main part of the day was over.</p>

<p>From supper time till the call to quarters, which
sounded at 9 P.M., the recruit was allowed to
do about as he pleased, though sometimes there
was instruction in the evening. The call to quarters
was the signal for all lights to be out in the
squad room, though it was not necessary for all
the soldiers to be there at that hour. They were,
however, expected to be there at ten o’clock when
taps were sounded, this being a bugle call for all
lights to be out, and every one in bed, except the
officers and sentries.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see where we’re going to have
an awful lot of time to scrabble around and have
fun,” said Bob, in a half-growling tone, as he
looked over the printed list of the camp schedule.
“We have from four-thirty to five-forty-five with
nothing to do, if we’re not in the guard-mount
stunt, and then we have time after supper. But
that isn’t much.”</p>

<p>“Say, what do you think you’re on—a vacation?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” answered Bob slowly.</p>

<p>“Not exactly! I should say not! Most emphatically—not!
You’re here, and so we all are,
to do our duty and beat the Germans, and if it
takes all day I’m willing!” went on Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been mentioned there are many kinds of
drills in the army, but the new recruits, such as
Ned, Bob, and Jerry, found, according to their
squad leader, that the physical drill was the most
important one for them at first. Later on would
come rifle drill, drill in the trenches, bayonet practice,
machine gun drill, rushes with hand grenades
and so on. There seemed to the boys to be no
end to it.</p>

<p>The boys of course, began at the very bottom to
learn about army work, and one of the first things
they were told was in regard to different formations,
or units. The squad is the smallest unit of
the infantry, to which branch of the service the
three chums were attached. A squad consists of
eight men, seven privates and a leader, who is,
generally, a corporal. This squad is the foundation
of the army, and the members of it generally
stay together, sleeping, eating and fighting in
unison with other squads.</p>

<p>After the squad comes the platoon, which is
made up of from two to six squads, and the men
are in charge of a lieutenant with a couple of non-commissioned
officers to help him. Four platoons
make a company, and this is in charge of a captain,
with two lieutenants to aid him.</p>

<p>The battalion of four companies comes next
and a major commands a battalion, while three
battalions usually make up a regiment, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
commanded by a colonel, with a number of staff
officers to advise and aid him. It takes two
regiments of infantry to make a brigade, which is
in charge of a brigadier general. Next comes a
division, which is the largest group in the army,
and is made up in various ways, from infantry and
artillery and machine gun battalions.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s up?” said Ned, as he walked
with his chums to the designated place. None of
them was in uniform, as yet. That would come
later.</p>

<p>“What do you mean—up?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I mean it looks as though we were going to
listen to a speech,” went on Ned.</p>

<p>And this was just what was going to happen.
The captain of the company to which they were
temporarily assigned, had gathered the recruits
about him.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you a few things before we begin
the physical drill,” he said, “so you will appreciate
the importance of it. If I did not, you might
think that some of it was of little use. But I want
to say that it all has a value that has been tried
and proved.</p>

<p>“You know the army that is to help whip Germany
is just like a big machine. You are all parts
in that machine, and every part, no matter how
small, must work in perfect unison with every
other part, or there will be failure. To begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with, you must be physically fit to stand much hard
work, and this drill is to get you in good condition.</p>

<p>“Some of the motions you are made to go
through may seem foolish to you, but they are all
for some good purpose. You have muscles which,
ordinarily, you seldom use. It is to bring out
these muscles, and make them fit for service, that
certain motions and practice are necessary.
You’ll be surprised on finding what a little exercise
will do for certain weak and flabby muscles that
you have. They will be waked up and made to
do their duty.”</p>

<p>And the boys found, before the day was over,
that their captain spoke the truth, and with a
knowledge that could not be questioned.</p>

<p>“Oh, look who’s here,” said Bob to Ned in a
low voice, as they had a little respite from twisting
and turning and stooping and rising.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That Pug Kennedy we had the row with in the
train. They’re going to put him in our squad,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” said Jerry. “But still it won’t
do to kick. This is only temporary, and he may
be changed, or we may. Don’t give up the ship
now.”</p>

<p>Pug Kennedy was, indeed, put in the squad with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the three Cresville friends, and his unpleasant face
grinned at them as the drill went on.</p>

<p>Pug Kennedy lived up to his reputation. He
was a “scrapper,” and he did little but growl at
every new order. He did not see any reason for
this, nor sense in that, and only the fact that he
did his growling in a low voice saved him from
being disciplined. The officers did not hear him.</p>

<p>It was three or four days after the arrival of
Ned, Bob, and Jerry at Camp Dixton that Bob
came hurrying up to his chums with a pleased look
on his face.</p>

<p>“What is it, Chunky?” asked Ned. “Have
you managed to squeeze another mess call into the
day’s program?”</p>

<p>“No. But we’re going to get into uniforms to-day.
I just heard our captain say so,” answered
the stout lad. “Now we’ll look like real soldiers!”</p>

<p>Bob was right. A few minutes later came the
call for the recruits to line up and proceed to the
quartermaster’s department to be measured for
uniforms.</p>

<p>“Now this is something like!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>HOT WORDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What’ll we do with our old suits?” asked
Ned, as, with his chums, he walked toward the
clothing department, a store in itself.</p>

<p>“They go into the discard,” answered Bob, who,
it seems, had been making inquiries. “I suppose
we can send ’em home and have ’em kept for us
until after the war.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m going to do,” declared Ned.
“This is a good suit, though it looks a bit mussy
now. I’m not going to throw it away.”</p>

<p>“You might as well,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why so? This war may not last as long as
we think,” Ned made comment. “And suits, and
everything else, will be a lot higher after it’s over.
Might as well save what I can. Don’t see why
it won’t do me any good.”</p>

<p>“Because it won’t fit you,” Jerry returned.
“Don’t you know what our captain told us? He
said the new uniforms we get will hang on some
of us like bags for a while, but when we fill out
our muscles by the exercise and drill, we’ll fill out
the uniforms, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now your tailor, Ned, and I will say he is a
good one, made your civilian suit to fit you. In
other words he favored you. He padded the
hollow places and so on. But in a couple of
months you’ll fill out so that the suit you’re wearing
now will look like a set of hand-me-downs
from the Bowery in New York.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll send it home, anyhow,” decided Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, it may come in handy for your mother’s
charity work,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>Before going to the tailor shop, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry, with others of the recruits, were measured.
These measurements were standardized, so that
when each young man went in to get his uniform,
the officer in charge merely called off a certain
number to designate coat, trousers, hat and so on.</p>

<p>The first outfit issued to the boys consisted of
one coat, a pair of trousers, a hat, with cord,
three pairs of drawers, two pairs of laces, a pair
of leggings, a set of ornaments, an overcoat, two
flannel shirts, two pairs of shoes, six pairs of socks,
a belt, a pair of gloves and three undershirts.
The value of each article was set down and varied
from a hat cord, marked as worth six and a half
cents, to an overcoat, which cost the government
$14.50, making a total of about $45 for each
young soldier. For this, of course, Ned, Bob,
and Jerry paid nothing. A private gets his uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and food for nothing, but an officer has to
buy his.</p>

<p>“Return to barracks and get into your uniforms
for inspection,” was the order the boys received,
and they were glad to do it. There were some,
like Ned, who sent their civilian clothes home to
be used as parents saw fit, and there was a general
opinion, coinciding with Jerry’s, that they
would be of little use to the owners themselves
after their army service, for the young men would,
indeed, be of different physical appearance and
size.</p>

<p>“Well, how do I look?” asked Ned, as he and
his two chums finished dressing in the barracks.</p>

<p>“It fits you sort of quick,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>The new uniform was, in truth, a trifle loose.</p>

<p>“Yours fits the same way,” laughed Ned. “I
guess I’ll do a double stunt of exercise to fill out
quicker.”</p>

<p>“Bob looks good in his,” commented the tall
motor boy. “It’s because he’s so fat. When he
loses some of his flesh he’ll look as though he was
wearing a meal sack.”</p>

<p>“Watch your own step,” said Bob, with a laugh.
“I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>There were jokes and jests among the recruits
about the appearance of one another, and when
Pug Kennedy walked out on the way to drill, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which the squad was summoned, Jerry called to
him:</p>

<p>“You’ve got your hat cord on backwards, old
man.”</p>

<p>It was not that Jerry felt any particular liking
for Michael Kennedy, to give him his real name,
but the tall lad did not want any member of his
squad to look unmilitary, nor did he want a reprimand
to be directed toward Pug, as it might reflect
on his companions. But Pug Kennedy was
still in an ungracious mood, it seemed, for he answered
Jerry’s well-meant remark with:</p>

<p>“Mind your own business! It’s my hat cord.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” agreed Jerry, good-naturedly;
“but it may not be long, if you wear it that way.”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Pug, as he went out. But Ned
took notice that, as soon as he was out of sight
around the corner of the barracks, the bully put
the cord on differently. It was a light blue cord,
and indicated to those who knew the regulations,
that the man under the hat belonged to the infantry,
or foot-soldier, branch of the army.</p>

<p>The cavalry wear yellow cords on their hats;
and the artillery, red. The engineers have a red
and white mixed cord; the signal corps, orange
and white; the medical corps, maroon; and the
quartermaster corps, buff.</p>

<p>In addition there are certain ornaments on the
collars of the coats to distinguish the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
branches of the service. The infantry wear
crossed rifles, the cavalry crossed sabers, the field
artillery crossed cannon, the engineers a castle,
like the castle in a set of chessmen, the signal
corps crossed flags with a torch between, the
quartermaster corps wheel with a pen and sword
crossed and an eagle surmounting, while the members
of the medical corps wear something that
looks like an upright bar with wings at the top
and two snakes twining around it. This is a
caduceus, and is a form of the staff usually associated
with the god Mercury. The word comes
from the Doric and means to proclaim, literally a
herald.</p>

<p>“He took your advice, Jerry,” announced Ned,
when he saw what Pug Kennedy had done.</p>

<p>“Glad he did. He might have been a little
more polite about it, though. I wish he was in
some other squad, but I suppose there’s no use
trying to graft him somewhere else. We’ll just
have to make the best of him.”</p>

<p>“Or the worst,” added Bob.</p>

<p>In their new uniforms the recruits went through
the drill, and it could not be denied that now
there was a little more snap to it. It was more
inspiring to see men all dressed alike doing something
in unison than to watch the same company
going through motions, one in a brown suit, another
in a green and a third in a blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The drill was hard, and it never seemed to end.
When one stopped, there was only a brief rest
period, and then came another. But it was necessary,
and the boys were beginning to feel that.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the folks at home would think
if they could see us now?” asked Ned, as their
respite came.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they wouldn’t be ashamed of
us,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” declared Bob, smoothing
out some imaginary wrinkles. “I think we look
all to the mustard!”</p>

<p>“Or cheese!” chuckled Ned. “Come on—there
goes mess call,” he added, for it was noon,
and time for dinner.</p>

<p>As it was Friday there was chowder as the
main dish. There were fried fish, candied sweet
potatoes, green peas, fruit pudding, mustard
pickles, bread and coffee. It was a plentiful meal,
and several made a trip to the kitchen for a second
helping.</p>

<p>Bob was one of these, and it was when he was
walking back to his place at the long table that
something happened which nearly caused considerable
trouble.</p>

<p>Bob was carrying his filled plate in one hand,
and his cup of coffee in the other, when, as he
passed the bench where Pug Kennedy was sitting,
some one bumped into the stout lad, jostling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
arm, and the coffee—or part of it—went down
Pug’s back.</p>

<p>Up the bully sprang with a howl, though the
coffee was not hot enough to burn him.</p>

<p>“Who did that?” he demanded, wrathfully.</p>

<p>There was no need to answer. The attitude
of Bob, standing directly back of Pug, with the
half-emptied cup in his hand and the queer look
on his face, told more plainly than words that he
was the guilty one.</p>

<p>“Oh, so it’s you again, is it, you sneak!” and
Pug fairly snarled the words.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Bob, justly
angry.</p>

<p>“I mean that you’re trying to make trouble for
me again—like the time when you accused me of
stealing your crullers. You’re trying to spoil my
uniform so I’ll get a call-down. I’ll fix you for
this!”</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” insisted Bob. “Some one
ran against me, and——”</p>

<p>“Accident my eye!” sneered Pug. “I’ll accident
you! I’ll punch you good and proper, that’s
what I’ll do!” he yelled, and he leaped back over
the bench-seat and advanced toward Bob who
stepped back.</p>

<p>A fight was imminent.</p>

<small>A MIDNIGHT MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Put down your things and put up your
hands!” Pug Kennedy fairly issued the order to
Bob as an officer might have done.</p>

<p>“Why should I?” asked the stout youth. “I
haven’t finished my dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not going to until I finish you.
Come on! Put up your hands! I’m a scrapper,
but I won’t hit any one with his hands full. Put
’em up, I say, or I’ll smash you in a minute!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you hit him!” called Ned, hastily arising
from the opposite side of the table.</p>

<p>“Mind your own business!” ordered Pug.</p>

<p>“Take some one your size!” came a voice from
the end of the hall.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you if you want me to!” snapped Pug.</p>

<p>He took a step nearer Bob, and the latter, in
very self-defense, was about to set down his plate
and cup, when Captain Trainer, who had a habit
of unexpectedly dropping into the mess hall, entered
the big room. He took in, at a glance, what
was about to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried in commanding tones.
“What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“He spilled a lot of hot coffee down my back!”
growled Pug, but he had lost some of his belligerency
since the advent of his captain.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” explained Bob. “It was an
accident, some one jostled me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Captain Trainer. “That is
equivalent to an apology, Kennedy, and I direct
you to accept it as such.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m sorry,” said Bob. “I really
didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“All right,” half growled Pug. “If you do it
again, though, I’ll punch you worse than I did
before!” and he glared at Bob.</p>

<p>The captain, seeing that he had averted hostilities
for the time being, thought it best to withdraw.
Enlisted men, especially at meals, like to be free
from restraint, and an officer, no matter how much
he is liked by his command, is a sort of damper at
times.</p>

<p>Pug squirmed and twisted, trying to wipe some
of the coffee stains from the back of his coat and
Bob went on to his place to finish his meal.</p>

<p>“There’ll be trouble with that fellow before
we are through with him,” said Jerry to his chums
in a low voice, as they went out of the mess hall,
for a little rest before drill was resumed.</p>

<p>“He’s made trouble enough already,” said Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
“Though of course it is rather raw to have coffee
spilled down your back. But I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” agreed Jerry. “But what I
meant was that we’ll have personal trouble with
him. He seems always spoiling for a fight, and
more so when we are concerned than any one else.
Maybe he doesn’t like being in the same squad
with us.”</p>

<p>“He can’t dislike it any more than we do,”
suggested Ned. “Just wait until I get made a
corporal and have charge! Then I’ll make him
step around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to get promoted to a corporal?”
asked Jerry. “I didn’t know that was on
the bill,” and he winked at Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure I’m going to be promoted,” went on Ned.
“Aren’t you working for that?”</p>

<p>And Jerry and Bob had to admit that they were,
though it was rather early in the game to expect
anything.</p>

<p>The first step upward from private, the lowest
army rank, is to be made a corporal, and, after
that one becomes a sergeant. A corporal wears
two V-shaped stripes, on his sleeves. The V in
each case is inverted. A sergeant has three such
stripes. There are various sorts of sergeants—duty
or line sergeants, staff and major sergeants,
mess sergeants, supply sergeants and so on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
first sergeant is often called “Top,” and sometimes
considers himself almost a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>Sergeants and corporals are non-commissioned
officers, and there is a great difference in rank between
a commissioned and a non-commissioned
man.</p>

<p>A commissioned officer can resign, and quit
when he wants to, but an enlisted man, or a non-commissioned
officer can not. Commissioned
officers are appointed by the President, and the
commission carries a certain rank, beginning with
second lieutenant. Each step upward means a
new commission. The sergeants and corporals
are appointed, nominally, by the colonel of their
regiment, by warrant.</p>

<p>“Well, then Pug had better look out for himself,
if you’re going to have it in for him when
you’re made corporal,” went on Jerry. “But say,
it must be fun to be an officer—even a non-commissioned
one.”</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Ned. “You get out of a lot of
work that isn’t any fun, such as being the kitchen
police, doing fatigue work like cleaning up the
barracks and grounds, digging drains and the like,
and when you’re on guard you don’t have to keep
on the go—all you have to do is to keep watch
over the other sentries.”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Me for it!” added Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that isn’t getting us anywhere just now,”
said Ned. “I’m detailed for kitchen police this
very day.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” admitted Bob, and, as it happened,
Jerry was, too.</p>

<p>When one is detailed to the kitchen police it
does not mean that the young soldier has to arrest
those who eat too much, or too little.</p>

<p>In an army camp the cooking is done, in most
instances, by soldiers detailed for it, though in
some cases professional cooks may be used, such
having enlisted or been drafted. Each day certain
members of the company are named to help
the cooks, of which there are usually three. The
helpers are known as the “kitchen police,” and
they do all sorts of work, peeling potatoes, washing
the pots and pans, scrubbing the floors, waiting
on table, bringing in coal and wood.</p>

<p>This kitchen policing goes by turn, so no one
man gets too much of it, or has to do it too steadily.
It was the first time Ned, Bob and Jerry
had been assigned to this duty, and they went at it
without grumbling, which is what every good soldier
does. Their many camping experiences stood
them in good stead in this, and the efficient manner
in which they went about their tasks in cleaning
up the pots and pans drew a compliment from
the professional cook.</p>

<p>“We’ll know our soup comes out of a clean pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the next time we eat,” said Bob, as he gave the
copper a final polish.</p>

<p>“And by the looks of things we’re going to
have a good feed to-morrow,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“We always do on Sunday,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>On Sundays in camp, reveille, mess and sick
calls are one hour later than on week days, giving
more opportunity for slumber, and on Saturdays
the first call for drill is not until 7:35 instead of
6:50, which is also a little relief.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’ll be a good dinner to-morrow,”
resumed Bob, as he passed the ice chest, having
occasion to open it. “Plenty of chicken and the
fixings.”</p>

<p>The Sunday dinner in camp, in fact, is usually
the long-looked-for meal of the week, and the
supper, likewise, is more elaborate than usual.
The feeding of the boys of the army is a science,
and it is worked out to what might be called
mathematical exactness.</p>

<p>For instance, at Camp Dixton each enlisted man
received, or was each day credited with, what is
called the “garrison ration.” This consisted of
a certain amount of fresh beef, flour, baking
powder, bran, potatoes, prunes, coffee, sugar,
evaporated milk, condiments, butter, lard, syrup
and flavoring extract.</p>

<p>Of course each man did not actually receive
these things, for, if he had, he would have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
trouble in getting them cooked, or in shape to eat.
But that was his allowance and he was entitled to
it or its equivalent, each article mentioned being
issued in certain specific measure or weight.</p>

<p>The soldiers were allowed to trade what they
did not want for things they did. They could
swap beef for mutton, bacon for hash and so on.
They could have rice for beans, or dried apples
for prunes, there being substitutes for almost every
ration issued.</p>

<p>“And a nice thing about it, too,” said Jerry,
when he and his chums were discussing it, “is that
you don’t have to eat it all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell Bob that, it’ll scare him,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean you can save some,” Jerry explained,
“and turn it into cash.”</p>

<p>“Do we spend the cash?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It isn’t usual. It’s turned back into the company
fund, and used to buy extras for special dinners—ice
cream and the like.”</p>

<p>While the ration spoken of is supposed to be
issued to each soldier, in reality it is not. He has
to take the meal the cook prepares each day, and
this is supervised by the mess sergeant. This official
is given the task of looking after the kitchen.
He is supposed to save a little here and there,
where he can, and convert mutton into ham and
eggs on occasions, and save enough on the prunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to have them turn into lemon pie once in a while.</p>

<p>All this Ned, Bob, and Jerry learned as they
went along. They finished their kitchen police
work, and were relieved from duty, taking the
occasion to go to the Y. M. C. A. headquarters
to write some letters.</p>

<p>“I wonder how things are in Cresville,” observed
Bob, as he carefully sealed one envelope,
and took care that his chums did not see the address.</p>

<p>“I had a paper from there the other day,” said
Jerry. “The old town seemed to be getting along
in spite of our absence.”</p>

<p>“No more fires?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No; didn’t read of any.”</p>

<p>“Crooked Nose wasn’t arrested for stealing the
old Frenchman’s money, or my father’s watch, or
Mrs. Hopkins’ brooch, was he?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“No. But the article said that the old man
insisted that he did lose a big sum on the occasion
of the blaze. He tells the same story he told us,
but I guess few believe he had much money.”</p>

<p>“All the same it was a mean trick, if some one
robbed the old man, and I’d like to catch Crooked
Nose, if there is such a person,” declared Ned
with energy.</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” added Bob. “Say,” he went
on, “have any of you written to Professor Snodgrass?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, and we ought to,” said Jerry. “We
ought to invite him down to camp. I heard he
was given a leave of absence, and there are some
queer bugs down here in camp that he might like
to look over.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drop him a line,” promised Jerry.</p>

<p>That night the three motor boys went on guard
together for a two-hour period just before midnight.
Their posts adjoined, and as they marched
back and forth they could speak now and again.</p>

<p>It was shortly before twelve o’clock, when the
camp was wrapped in darkness and very still, that,
as Jerry passed a certain spot where there was a
small hollow among some trees, he saw, dimly
outlined against the sky, a figure crawling along
in a stooping position.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to challenge, for those were his
orders, when he saw a second figure crawl along,
from the direction of a public road outside the
camp, and join the first.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” mused Jerry, as he observed
the midnight meeting. “I’ll have to look into
this.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>A STAB IN THE BACK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins was of two minds. He knew
his orders as sentry required him to challenge any
one trying to pass in or out of camp after hours
without a pass. And it did not seem likely that
these persons, whoever they were, would act so
suspiciously if they had passes. In fact, one came
from the direction of the barracks, and the other
from the town, which lay about three miles from
camp.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jerry knew that often some
of the boys stayed in town beyond the legal hour,
and tried to run past the guard without getting
caught, for in the latter event it meant punishment
for being out after taps.</p>

<p>The soldier boys were but human, and, naturally,
they did not want to see their fellow soldiers
get into trouble. So it was sometimes the custom
not to look too closely when some of the late-stayers
tried to run guard.</p>

<p>“If that’s all it is, I guess I can find something
to do at the other end of my post,” thought Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for he felt that, some day, he might want a similar
favor.</p>

<p>But as he was debating with himself he heard
Ned approaching, and he waited.</p>

<p>“Everything all right?” asked Ned in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” was the answer. “Did
you see anything suspicious?”</p>

<p>“Suspicious? No.”</p>

<p>“Take a look down in that hollow,” suggested
Jerry. As he pointed to indicate the place to Ned,
they both saw two figures in a crouching attitude on
the ground. They were two men, one in the unmistakable
uniform of a soldier, and the other a
civilian. And they appeared to be in close conversation.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to find out,” returned
Jerry. “I was just wondering whether to challenge
or not.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find out who they are first,”
suggested Ned. “If it’s just a couple of boys out
late.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was going to do,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“But one seems to be a civilian, and he hasn’t
any right around camp at this hour.”</p>

<p>“I’m going over and take a look.” Jerry spoke
now with decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” offered Ned. “It’s about
midway of both our posts.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned wanted to do their duty, as they
had been instructed by their officers, but, at the
same time, if by a little avoidance of a strict rendering
of the rules they could help out an indiscreet
fellow soldier, they were tempted to do that. It
all depended on what was taking place over there
in the dark hollow.</p>

<p>Of course there had been talk of enemy spies
and of German activities, and a great deal of it
had a basis in fact, or easily could have. And it
was true that a German spy could do a great deal
of damage around Camp Dixton if he tried.
There were great store-houses that could be set
on fire, there were barracks and stables that could
be burned, and more than one fire that did occur
during the early days may be set down as having
been the work of an enemy alien. If such were
the men meeting at midnight in the hollow, just
off the posts of Jerry and Ned, they wanted to
know it. Even if one did wear Uncle Sam’s uniform,
that was no reason for believing him true.
There are traitors in all walks of life.</p>

<p>“What do you make ’em out to be?” asked Ned
in a whisper of his tall chum.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure. One seems to be a soldier, but
the other isn’t. And the soldier, if he is that,
came from the direction of our place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Going to yell for the corporal of the guard?”</p>

<p>“Not yet a while. Let’s see who they are.”</p>

<p>The thick grass muffling their footsteps, Ned
and Jerry drew near to the place where they had
last seen the figures. They were not in sight now,
being crouched down in the dark shadows. But
as the boys paused to listen, they heard the murmur
of voices, and some one said:</p>

<p>“It’s a little soon to start anything yet. Wait
about a week and the place will be full. Then the
damage will be all the greater.”</p>

<p>“All right; just as you say,” came the response.
“Only my friends are getting impatient to have me
do something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll do it all right!” said the first
speaker. “And now you’d better hop along.
The sentries may be over this way any minute.
I’ve got to sneak back. See you again in the
usual way.”</p>

<p>Then came a silence, and Ned and Jerry looked
at one another in the darkness. They could just
make out each other’s outlines.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure I did. It was——”</p>

<p>“Pug Kennedy!” filled in Ned.</p>

<p>“And if the other didn’t speak with a German
accent I’ll never draw another ration.”</p>

<p>“Just what I think. But what does it mean?
Why should Pug Kennedy be out after hours, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the guard and meeting with men who may be
enemy aliens?”</p>

<p>“Can’t answer,” replied Jerry. “But it’s up to
us to find out. But let’s go easy. We don’t want
to make fools of ourselves, and start a false alarm.
Wait until we see what happens.”</p>

<p>They did not have long to wait. A few seconds
later they heard a shuffle in the grass, and a dim
figure came toward them. It was that of a soldier,
as Ned and Jerry could see. Of the second
person there was not a sign. But he might still
be in the dark hollow, or he may have crawled off.
At any rate it was Jerry’s duty to challenge, and
he did it.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he cried, bringing his rifle to “port,” as
the regulations called for. “Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“Friend,” was the answer, though the tone of
the reply was anything but friendly. “That you,
Hopkins?” came the inquiry.</p>

<p>“Yes. Who are you?” Jerry asked, though he
knew full well.</p>

<p>“I’m Kennedy. I’ve been out on a bit of a lark.
Can’t you look the other way a second until I
slip past?”</p>

<p>It was not an unusual request, and it was one
that was often complied with. Yet Jerry hesitated
a moment. Kennedy might be telling the
truth, and the midnight meeting might be innocent
enough. But it looked suspicious. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Jerry had reason to think that the fighter had
come from the barracks only recently—not that
he was just returning to them.</p>

<p>“Go on. Look the other way and I’ll slip past—that’s
a sport!” begged Pug Kennedy, and his
voice was more friendly now. “I’ll do as much
for you some day.”</p>

<p>It was an appeal hard to resist, and Jerry was
on the point of complying, while Ned was willing
to agree to it, when some one was heard walking
along from a point in back of the three young men.</p>

<p>“It’s the corporal!” hissed Kennedy. “Keep
your mouths shut and I’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p>He suddenly seemed to melt away in the darkness,
but he probably dropped down in the long
grass. The approaching footsteps came nearer
and a voice called:</p>

<p>“Hopkins! Slade! Are you there?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” was the answer, and Jerry and
Ned saw the corporal of the guard standing near
them.</p>

<p>“Anything the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I saw some one over here,” answered
Jerry, “and I came to look. But I don’t
see anything now.”</p>

<p>There was a very good reason for this. Jerry
had his eyes tightly shut!</p>

<p>“False alarm, was it?” asked the corporal with
a laugh. “Well, that often happens. But it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
best to be on the alert. There are some of the
boys out, and we want to catch them as examples.
If you see anything more give a call.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned turned away to go back on post
when something happened. It was a yell of pain,
and came from a point not far from where the
corporal had been talking to the two sentries.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Some one hurt,” answered Jerry. “I wonder——”</p>

<p>He did not have time to complete his surmise,
for the corporal called:</p>

<p>“Guard! Over this way! I’ve caught him!”</p>

<p>There was a sound of a struggle, and then a
light flashed. <a href="#image03">Ned and Jerry, hurrying over, saw
the corporal holding Pug Kennedy</a>, and flashing a
pocket electric light into the bully’s face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_147">NED AND JERRY, HURRYING OVER SAW THE CORPORAL
HOLDING PUG KENNEDY.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“You were right—there was some one here,”
said the corporal. “I stepped on his hand in the
dark and he yelled. Otherwise I might not have
seen him. Sorry, Kennedy, but it’s your own
fault,” went on the non-commissioned officer.
“Take him to the guardhouse,” he ordered Ned
and Jerry, and there was no choice for them but
to obey.</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with you for this!” growled Pug
Kennedy, as he marched along. “I’ll fix you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“We didn’t do anything,” said Jerry in a low
voice. “We were going to keep still.”</p>

<p>“Yes you were! You gave me away—that’s
what you did. You called the corporal and
peached on me! I’ll fix you for this!”</p>

<p>It was useless to protest, and Jerry and Ned
did not. Kennedy, muttering and growling, was
turned over to the keeper of the guardhouse, and
locked up for the rest of the night. He would
be given a hearing in the morning.</p>

<p>“How much shall we tell?” asked Ned of Jerry,
when they were relieved, and, with Bob, went to
turn in.</p>

<p>“Better not say anything until we’re asked,” was
Jerry’s opinion. “Let the corporal do the talking.
After all he found him, we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“But about the meeting in the dark, and the
talk we heard?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I was sure what it meant I’d speak of
it. But we may only get laughed at for imagining
things if we speak of it. And we haven’t much
to go on. Let the corporal do the talking.”</p>

<p>This they did, with the result that Pug Kennedy
was punished for being out after taps and trying
to run the guard, no very serious offense, but one
which carried with it an extra round of police
work—cleaning up around camp—and Pug was
more or less the laughing butt of his comrades.</p>

<p>“It’s all your fault!” he declared to Ned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Jerry. “You wait! I’ll get square with you!”</p>

<p>But as several days passed, and the “scrapper,”
as he was called, made no effort to carry out his
threat, Ned and Jerry rather forgot about it. As
for the midnight meeting, it seemed to have been
nothing more than an attempt on the part of Pug
Kennedy to be friendly with some civilian he had
met in town.</p>

<p>“Though what they were talking about I can’t
guess,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>The days in camp were spent in drill. It was
drill, drill, drill from morning until night.</p>

<p>Most of the drills were for the purpose of getting
the new soldiers in good physical shape, fit to
stand the hard work that would come later. To
the three motor boys it was much the same sort of
thing they had gone through when training for
football. There were the preliminary steps, the
slow movements, followed by speeding-up practice
and then hard driving.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks they learned how
to march in unison, how to go through certain
parts of the rifle drill without making it look too
ragged, and finally, one day, orders were issued
for bayonet drill.</p>

<p>“This is beginning to look like real war, now,”
said Ned in delight, as he and his chums got their
guns and bayonets ready for the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it to be, trench or with the bags?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Bags,” answered Jerry, who had been reading
the orders. “The trench work comes later.”</p>

<p>There are several kinds of bayonet drill and exercise,
and among them are trench and bag work.
In the former, which is only used after the youths
have become somewhat familiar with the weapon,
there are two lines of soldiers. One is down in
a trench, and they are “attacked” by another line
standing above them, the theory being that the
party outside the trench is the attacking one.</p>

<p>Bag bayonet work is something on the same
scale as tackling the dummy in football practice.
On a wooden framework a number of canvas bags,
filled with sawdust, shavings, hay or other soft
material, are suspended. On each bag, which
swings freely by two ropes, are painted two white
dots. These, in a measure, correspond to the
scarlet heart on the buffer of a fencer.</p>

<p>Standing in a row before the swinging bags,
with leveled bayonets, the young soldiers endeavor
to stab through the object as near the white spots
as possible. This is to train their eyes.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry, with their comrades, were
marched to the practice ground, and then, after
some preliminary instruction and illustrative work
by men proficient in the drill, the lads were allowed
to do it themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks easy, but it’s hard,” declared Bob,
when he had made several wild lunges, to the
no small danger of the man next him.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, Chunky,” advised Jerry.
“You’ve got more than a week to stay here. Go
slow.”</p>

<p>Pug Kennedy, who was stationed next to Ned,
had done better than any of the others. Perhaps
his proficiency with his fists stood him in good
stead. However that may have been, he won
commendation from the officer in charge.</p>

<p>“Now for a general attack!” came the orders,
after a while. “I want to see how you’d act if you
were told to go over the top and smash a crowd
of Germans! Lively now!”</p>

<p>The boys went at it with a will, one or two fairly
ripping the bags from their fastenings.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry of pain, and Jerry saw
Ned stagger in the line, and drop his rifle. Then
Ned fell, and on the back of his olive shirt there
appeared a crimson stain. Ned had been stabbed
by a bayonet.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A CAVE-IN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Momentary confusion followed Ned’s cry and
his fall, and those nearest him, when they saw the
blood, felt a good deal of alarm. But efficient
officers were in charge of the drilling squads, and
a few sharp orders sufficed to bring the men back
in line, while an examination was made of the
injured lad.</p>

<p>He was bleeding freely, but when his shirt was
taken off it was seen that a bayonet had struck him
a glancing blow, cutting a long, but not deep, gash
in the fleshy part of his back.</p>

<p>“How did this happen? Did any one see it?”
asked the officer in charge of the instruction.</p>

<p>“It was——” began a lad who had been standing
next to Ned.</p>

<p>“I did it!” growled out the unpleasant voice of
Pug Kennedy. “But I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“I should hope not,” commented the officer,
rather sharply. “But how did it happen?”</p>

<p>“He leaned over and got right in my way just
as I was making a lunge,” explained the fighter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“I tried to hold back my gun but it was too late.”</p>

<p>The officer looked sharply at Kennedy, but
there seemed to be no good reason why his word
should be doubted.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Captain Reel, who was giving
the bayonet instruction. “Only be more careful
after this. Save such strokes for the Germans.
We can’t afford to lose any of our soldiers.
This will be all for to-day.”</p>

<p>Ned had been carried to the infirmary, and
thither, having received permission to do so, went
Bob and Jerry. They were met by an orderly
who, on hearing their inquiries, told them that
Ned’s wound was not at all serious, and that he
would be kept in his bed only long enough to
make sure there would be no infection from the
steel and to enable the wound to heal slightly.</p>

<p>Later in the day they were allowed to see their
chum. Ned was on a cot in the infirmary, and he
smiled at Jerry and Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not out of the game for long,” he
said, in answer to their inquiries. “I’ll be a bit
stiff for a day or so, the doc says, but it’ll soon
wear off.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Jerry. “Did you
really get in his way as he says you did?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it if I did,” answered Ned. “I
was just making a lunge myself, and I’d been doing
it right along, so I knew my distance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“He did it on purpose,” insisted Bob. “I was
talking to the fellow who was on the other side of
Pug Kennedy, and he says there was plenty of
room. He did it on purpose to get even with you,
Ned, for the way he was caught the other night,
when he tried to run the guard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,” objected
Jerry. “Pug Kennedy is a scrapper, and
he doesn’t like us. But I don’t believe he’d deliberately
try to bayonet a chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to believe,” returned
Ned. “I thought I had plenty of room on each
side of me, but my foot may have slipped. Or
maybe Pug’s may have done the same thing.”</p>

<p>“He made it slip!” declared Bob. “He wanted
to get square with you and he took that way.”</p>

<p>“If he did it’s a pretty serious way,” said Jerry,
“and he ought to be dismissed from the service.
But it’s going to be as hard to prove that as it
would be to prove that he had some plot on foot
when he met that man at midnight. I don’t believe
we can do anything unless we get better
proof.”</p>

<p>“Oh, drop it all!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s only
a scratch, anyhow, and it won’t kill me. There’s
just as much chance that it was an accident as that
he did it on purpose. I’m not going to make any
accusation against him.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it would be wise,” agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Jerry. “But, at the same time, we’ll keep watch
on him. He may try something like it again.”</p>

<p>Ned’s prediction as to the lightness of his injury
proved correct. In two days he was out of the
infirmary, and though he was not allowed to go
in for violent drill for a week afterward, he said
he felt capable of it.</p>

<p>Pug Kennedy made a sort of awkward apology
for his share in the accident.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to do it,” he said to Ned. “But
either you leaned over too far toward me, or else
I slipped. You may think I did it on purpose, on
account of you giving me away to the corporal that
night, but I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with your getting caught
when you went out from barracks that night,”
said Ned. “It was your own fault. As for getting
square—you’re welcome to try.”</p>

<p>“Who says I was going out of barracks?”
asked Pug vindictively.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you?” Ned asked.</p>

<p>“No. Course not. I was coming in, and I
sort of got lost in the dark. I didn’t know my
way and I asked a fellow I met. He was one of
the teamsters, I guess. I was talking to him,
when I was caught—I mean you saw me and then
the corporal came.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t send for him,” declared Jerry
“He just happened to come at that moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it looked as if you’d sent for him,”
growled Pug. “I’d be glad to think you didn’t.
And I’m sorry you’re hurt,” he added to Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not hurt much,” was the easy answer.
“Next time I’ll give you plenty of room when
there’s bayonet drill.”</p>

<p>Whether Pug liked this or not, he did not say.
But he went away muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Ned was soon back with his chums again, drilling
away, and dreaming of the time when he and
they could go to France to fight the Huns. But
much preliminary work was necessary. It was,
as has been said, drill, drill, drill from morning
until night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boys were beginning to appreciate
what the army life was doing for them.
They were becoming better physically, every day;
as hard as nails and as brown as berries.</p>

<p>They wrote enthusiastic letters home, and received
letters in reply, giving the news of Cresville.
Matters there were about the same.
There had been no more “peace” meetings, though
it was said that Mr. Schaeffer and his fellow pro-Germans
were contemplating another big meeting
as a protest against the draft, which had been put
into operation.</p>

<p>The place where the fire had been was still a
heap of ruins, Mrs. Hopkins wrote Jerry, and it
had not been cleared because of a dispute over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the insurance money. Mr. Cardon, the Frenchman,
had recovered from his experience, though
he still talked about the loss of his money, which,
he insisted, a man with a crooked nose had stolen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think his story is true,” wrote Mrs. Hopkins.
“But nobody has seen the man with the
crooked nose, and there is positively no trace of
Mr. Baker’s watch nor of my diamond brooch.
Mr. Martley’s creditors have found his affairs in
such a mess that there will be next to nothing
coming to them—so if the watch and brooch are
not recovered we will have to stand the loss ourselves.”</p></div>

<p>“Isn’t that the limit!” cried Jerry, as he read
this portion of the letter to his chums.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet my dad feels sore,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass wrote to the boys, telling
them he hoped soon to pay them a visit. He was
finishing cataloging the bugs he had caught on his
last trip to Cresville, he stated, and would soon
be on the lookout for more.</p>

<p>It was two weeks after Ned’s injury by a bayonet
in the hands of Pug Kennedy, and he was
fully himself again, that, one afternoon as he and
his chums were getting ready for hand grenade
drill, a cry came from a section of the camp near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the artillery unit. There was a series of shouts
following a salvo of heavy guns.</p>

<p>“There’s been an accident!” exclaimed Jerry,
as he saw a number of officers and men running.</p>

<p>“Cannon exploded, maybe,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“It didn’t sound so,” remarked Ned. “The
noise wasn’t any louder than usual. But it’s something,”
he added. “There go the ambulances!”</p>

<p>As he spoke a number of the vehicles dashed
across the parade ground toward the place that
seemed to be the center of excitement.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned. “We’ve got to see
what this is!”</p>

<p>The motor boys started to run, followed by
several of their new chums, and on all sides there
were questions.</p>

<p>“What is it? What happened?”</p>

<p>A sentry, who did not leave his post, gave the
first information.</p>

<p>“A line of trenches caved in!” he said. “A lot
of the men are buried alive!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A PRACTICE MARCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Had such an accident as had occurred at Camp
Dixton taken place in the midst of a big city street,
there would have been so much excitement and
conflict that the result would have been magnified
in seriousness.</p>

<p>As it was there was enough seriousness to it,
but it was minimized by the fact that the accident
happened in the midst of a military camp, and
among men who are used to meeting resolutely
every sort of accident and emergency.</p>

<p>Short and sharp were the orders issued. Those
who could not be of help were halted before they
reached the place, and were held in readiness for
any work that would be needed.</p>

<p>The three friends, being among the first to
reach the scene, were put in one of the rescue
squads. It did not take long to understand what
had happened. Trenches had been dug in many
parts of the camp to give the men training under
the conditions they would find in France and Flanders.
But there had been some heavy rain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
when a battery of heavy guns was fired too near
a certain line of the trenches, the soft earth slid
in on top of the men occupying the defenses.
They were buried, a number of them being covered
out of sight.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were plenty of entrenching
tools on hand, and the first thing to do was to begin
digging the men out. This was done under
the direction of men of the engineer corps, who
were experts in this work.</p>

<p>A hasty calling of the roll showed that twenty
men had been caught in the cave-in, and within
five minutes every one had been dug out. Several
were unconscious, but there were pulmotors in the
camp, and these were used until all but one of the
victims was breathing naturally, if faintly. This
one man died, and several had broken arms, legs
and other injuries.</p>

<p>It was a serious and sad accident, and, for a
time, cast a gloom over the camp. But it was one
of those seemingly unavoidable things for which
no one in particular was to blame. A court martial
was held, and the officer in charge of the work
exonerated.</p>

<p>Nor was the commander of the battery, the
firing of the guns of which loosened the soft earth,
held responsible. He had nothing to do with the
trenches, and it was not his fault.</p>

<p>The accident had its effect, though, in causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
greater care to be taken in making trenches after
that, and bag or basket work was used, to better
bind the earth together. It was a soft and sandy
soil, without much body to it, and it shifted more
easily than would earth that had a clay mixture.</p>

<p>The accident was also used to good advantage
in causing a deeper study of trench work, and the
manner of making the trenches and laying them
out. Many of the recruits had a deep-seated aversion
to grubbing in the ground, digging trenches,
but it was part of the drill work and had to be
done. The lads likened it to sewer work, and no
one liked it.</p>

<p>After the accident one of the French officers,
who was an instructor in camp, gave a series of
lectures on trench warfare, and at the conclusion
there was not only a noticeable improvement in
the trenching, but there was more enthusiasm
about it.</p>

<p>“A trench may save our lives when we get to
France,” was the way Jerry expressed it. “I’m
going to learn all I can about them.”</p>

<p>“Same here!” echoed Ned.</p>

<p>What with athletic work, learning the different
marching and fighting formations, doing the necessary
police work, studying the mechanism of rifles
and machine guns, learning how to signal, digging
trenches, throwing hand grenades and dozens of
other things, Ned, Bob and Jerry were kept busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from morning until night. So with the other recruits.</p>

<p>Of course there was a certain time set aside for
play and amusement, and each young soldier was
told to play as hard as he worked. This was so
he might come back to his tasks refreshed, and
with the desire to give them the very best that was
in him.</p>

<p>The motor boys soon realized that the making
of a soldier was a task that was growing in complication.
There were many new ways of fighting,
and defending oneself, and all these had to
be mastered.</p>

<p>The use of the aeroplane, camouflage, hand
grenades, rifle grenades and many other new and
terrible forms of fighting made new systems necessary.
In gas attacks alone there was enough
to study to keep them busy many days in the week,
and this branch was regarded as so important that
drill after drill was held merely in teaching the
boys the best and most rapid manner of adjusting
the masks.</p>

<p>All this time Ned, Bob and Jerry were progressing.
They were becoming stronger physically,
and better able to stand hardship and exposure.
They could take long marches, carrying
heavy packs, without getting over tired, and they
knew how to bind up wounds, how to apply first-aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
dressings, and how to carry wounded comrades
from the field.</p>

<p>Of course there was much that was unpleasant
and hard. Many of their associates were different
from those they had been used to, and they
had to do what they were told—obey orders. No
longer were they their own masters. They lived
by rule and rote, and every minute of the day,
save the recreation hours, had to be accounted for.</p>

<p>But they knew it was doing them good, and they
knew it was in a good cause—the cause of humanity
and world-betterment—and they did not complain,
except perhaps in a good-natured way, and
occasionally.</p>

<p>They had several more or less unpleasant encounters
with Pug Kennedy and fellows of his
ilk, but this was to be expected. Ned’s back completely
healed and he was able to take his place
in the hardest drills with his chums.</p>

<p>Somewhat to the surprise of the boys they
found that rifle work was not rated as highly as
they had expected it would be, for the reason, they
were told, that it has been found that in the present
war machine guns and artillery play such a
big part.</p>

<p>Of course, for some time to come, the rifle will
be the arm of the infantry soldier. But it is coming
to be more and more an auxiliary, and not a
direct means to an end. Hand grenades can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
much damage in the enemy trenches, and are easier
to carry than a rifle and many rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>But of course there was rifle practice, and many
a day the motor boys and their chums spent on the
ranges, perfecting their aim. Every encouragement
was offered them to become expert marksmen,
and the three friends were not far from the
front when the markings were made.</p>

<p>The spring had given place to summer, and the
camp was not any too cool. But there were
shower baths, and the officers were not over severe
in drills when the weather was too hot.
There was plenty of chance to cool off between
drills.</p>

<p>Occasionally the boys would have short leaves
of absence, on which they made trips to town and
took in a show or two, getting in on “smileage”
books, or reduced rate tickets.</p>

<p>It was after a hard day in the trenches, practice
at bayonet drill, and hand grenade throwing that
Bob came into the Y. M. C. A. canteen where
Jerry and Ned had preceded him and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you see the notice?”</p>

<p>“What notice?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is Pug Kennedy going to be transferred?”
Ned demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” announced Bob, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
slumped into a chair. He had lost considerable
flesh and looked the better for it.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” some one asked. “Has
Germany given up the war?”</p>

<p>“I hope not until we get a chance to have a
whack at her!” exclaimed Jerry. “But shoot,
Bob! What is it?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a practice march,” was
the answer. “There’s just been a notice posted
about it. We’re to go in heavy marching order,
across country, and live just as we would if we
were in an enemy’s land.”</p>

<p>“That’s the cheese!” cried Ned. “We can live
a sort of free and easy life.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you fool yourself, son,” said an older
man. “I’ve been on these practice marches before.
How are your feet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty good.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll need to be,” was the answer.
“Toting seventy pounds on your back, through
mud puddles, over rough country, uphill, downhill,
isn’t any picnic. Just wait!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>CROOKED NOSE AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Forward—march!”</p>

<p>Snappily the command rolled out and it set in
motion hundreds of khaki-clad figures, each one
with a rifle and a pack on his back.</p>

<p>The hike, or practice march, from Camp Dixton
had started. After days of preparation, the
laying out of a route, and the sending forward of
supplies to meet the small army of men at different
places along the way, the start had been
made.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry recalled the rather direful
prediction of the soldier who had told them a
marcher was only as good as his feet, but they
were not worried.</p>

<p>“I guess we can keep up as long as the next
one,” Jerry had said.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to!” declared Ned. “We can’t
be shirkers.”</p>

<p>“I only hope I don’t get hungry,” said Bob,
with rather a woebegone face. “I’m going to put
some cakes of chocolate in my pocket, so I can
have something to nibble on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t,” advised the same soldier who had
spoken about their feet. “Don’t eat sweet stuff
until just before you can stop to take a drink.
Candy will make you thirsty, and the worst thing
you can do is to take a drink on the march. Wait
until you stop. I’ve tried it, and I know.”</p>

<p>And so the march had started. The route was
in a big circle about the camp as a center, and
would take about five days. The men were to
sleep in dog tents, camping at certain designated
points, and eating the rations they carried with
them and the food that would be brought to them
by supply trains that accompanied the army. It
was to be as much like a hike through a hostile
land as it was possible to make it.</p>

<p>In order to make the illusion complete—that
of having the young soldiers imagine they were
at actual warfare—the same sort of marching was
to prevail as would have prevailed had the men
from Camp Dixton been on their way to take their
place in the front line trenches, bordering on No
Man’s Land, or as if they were hastening to the
relief of a sorely-tried division.</p>

<p>To that end it was ordered that the day’s march
should be broken up into periods. That is, the
soldiers would march at the regulation speed for
a certain number of miles, a distance depending,
to a certain degree, on the nature of the land and
whether or not it was uphill or downhill. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
end of the distance a halt would be called, and the
men would be allowed ten minutes’, or perhaps a
half hour’s, rest. They were told not to take off
their packs during this period, as it would be hard
to get them adjusted to their backs again, but they
were instructed to ease themselves as much as
possible, by resting the weight of their packs on
some convenient rock, log or hummock.</p>

<p>And so down the road went Ned, Bob and
Jerry, in the midst of their chums of the army—boys
and men with whom they had formed, for
the most part, desirable acquaintances.</p>

<p>“This is one fine day,” remarked Jerry, as he
and his friends trudged along together.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” agreed Ned. “How
about it, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, I guess,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Chunky is worrying so much about whether
or not he will have enough to eat that he doesn’t
know whether the sun is shining or whether it’s a
rainy day,” laughed a friend on the other side of
the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Well, I like my meals,” said the stout one, and
there was more laughter.</p>

<p>On and on marched the young soldiers. Their
officers watched them closely, not only to gain a
knowledge of the characteristics of the men, but
to note any who might be in distress, and also for
signs of stragglers who might purposely delay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
march from a spirit of sheer laziness. The
younger officers were given points on the method
of marching and the care of their men by those
who had been through the ordeal before. It was
a sort of school for all concerned.</p>

<p>The day was hot, and the roads were dusty, and
to trudge along under those circumstances with
seventy pounds, more or less, strapped to one’s
back was difficult and trying work. But there was
very little grumbling. Each man knew he had to
do his bit, and, after all, there was a reason for
everything, and a deep spirit of patriotism had
possession of all.</p>

<p>Now and then some one started a song, and the
chorus was taken up by all who could hear the
air. This singing was encouraged by the officers,
for there is nothing that makes for better spirit
than a strain of music or a song on the march.</p>

<p>They passed through a farming country, and
on all sides were evidences of the work of the
farmers. The injunction from Washington to
raise all possible seemed to have been taken to
heart by the agriculturists.</p>

<p>Among the volunteers were many boys from
cities, who had never seen much of country life,
and some of their remarks were amusing, as they
noted what was being done on the farms.</p>

<p>During one of the halts, when Ned, Bob and
Jerry, with some of their chums, were resting beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the road near a farmhouse, Jerry saw a somewhat
lively scene being enacted near the red barn
which was part of the farm outfit. Pug Kennedy
and one or two of his cronies were chasing
some chickens.</p>

<p>As Jerry watched, he saw Pug knock a chicken
down with the butt of his rifle, and then seize the
stunned fowl, and slip it inside his shirt, which
was big and baggy. Just as the scrapper did
this a man came out of the barn and began to remonstrate
with the soldiers, of whom Pug was
one. But the Cresville friends noted that Pug
walked away and came toward them. The bulge
in his shirt, made where he had hidden the chicken,
was plain to be seen.</p>

<p>The man who had come out of the barn was
evidently accusing the soldiers to whom he was
talking of having taken his chicken. They denied
it, and offered to be searched. They could easily
afford to do this.</p>

<p>The farmer, getting little satisfaction, came
back to appeal to the company commander, who
heard his story—one to the effect that a chicken
had been stolen.</p>

<p>As looting was strictly forbidden, and as orders
had been given to make good any loss met by
civilians on account of the soldiers, it was necessary
to conduct an inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain started to question his men, but he
had not proceeded far when he came to Pug.</p>

<p>“Did you take his chicken?” the scrapper was
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw! What would I want of a raw
chicken?” was the answer.</p>

<p>Just then Jerry gave a loud sneeze, ending with
an exclamation of “Ker-choo!” which sounded a
bit like a rooster’s crow.</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, but Jerry had not
done it intentionally, and the officer seemed to
know that. But Jerry had been standing near
Pug Kennedy when this happened, and the sneeze
must have brought the hidden chicken to its senses.
It suddenly began to struggle inside Pug’s shirt,
and cackled. Perhaps it thought it heard the call
of a comrade fowl in Jerry’s sneeze.</p>

<p>“Ah, I think we have what we want,” said the
officer. “Kennedy, bring the chicken here!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any——”</p>

<p>Again the hen cackled and stirred within the
bully’s shirt. The evidence was conclusive.
There was a laugh, and with an air of having
been caught in a petty trick Pug took out the fowl,
not much the worse for its experience, and handed
it to the farmer.</p>

<p>“If we weren’t on a hike, I’d send you to the
guardhouse for that,” said the officer sternly.
“You know what the orders are against this sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of business. I’ll take up your case when we get
back to camp. Fall in!”</p>

<p>Kennedy muttered something, and shot a look
of anger at Jerry.</p>

<p>“That was your fault,” he said.</p>

<p>“My fault?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you sneezed on purpose like a rooster,
and you woke up the hen!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off! I sneezed by accident.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you!” said Pug. “I’ll get
square all right!”</p>

<p>This seemed his favorite threat.</p>

<p>Jerry laughed. It seemed too far-fetched to
be worth noticing, but he was later to remember
the promise of the bully.</p>

<p>The farmer, his chicken restored to him, was
satisfied, and the march was taken up again.
Nothing of moment occurred the rest of that day,
and at night a halt was made, and the dog tents
put up in the fields and woods near the road. Each
man carried half a tent, and by combining the
two halves shelter for the largest part of a man’s
body was secured. It was not as comfortable
sleeping as in the barracks, but the night was warm
and the boys were full of enthusiasm, which made
up for a lot.</p>

<p>They were gaining valuable experience, and,
aside from minor troubles, every one was satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>It was late the next afternoon, and considerable
ground had been covered, when something happened
that had to do with Jerry, Ned and Bob.
They, as well as every one else, were thinking of
the coming night’s rest and a meal, when the order
was given to rest, it being the last of those occasions
for the day, preparatory to going into camp
for the night.</p>

<p>As Ned, Bob and Jerry were taking what comfort
they could beside the road, the stout youth
looked up as a wagon passed. In it was a man,
seemingly a farmer, and though he drove by
quickly Bob exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Jerry lazily.</p>

<p>“Crooked Nose!” answered Bob, greatly excited.
“He’s the man we saw in Cresville the
night of the fire when the Frenchman was robbed!
Look, there he is!” and he pointed to the retreating
wagon, which turned off down a side road.</p>

<p>“Look here, Chunky!” exclaimed Jerry, with
one look at his stout chum and another at the
tail-end of the wagon. “Is this a joke, or what?”</p>

<p>“Mostly what, I guess,” put in Ned. “If it’s a
joke I don’t see the point, giving us heart disease
that way. What do you mean? Was it Crooked
Nose?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” retorted Bob as nearly
sharp as his bubbling good-nature ever permitted
him to be. “I tell you I saw the same man, with
the same crooked nose, that ran into you, Jerry,
in the restaurant that night in Cresville when we
had the fire.”</p>

<p>“Naturally if it was the same man he had the
same nose,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, it was the same man all right,” went on
Bob. “I don’t very often forget a face.”</p>

<p>“Nor the time to eat,” added Jerry with a
laugh. “Never mind, it will soon be time,
Chunky. Don’t let your stomach get the best of
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I mean I guess you’re getting delirious from
want of food. You’re seeing things.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I saw that man with the crooked
nose!” asserted Bob. “And moreover I think it’s
our duty to follow him, and see what he’s doing
here. He may have my father’s watch, and Mrs.
Hopkins’ brooch.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s true,” agreed Jerry. “But
we’ve got pretty slim evidence to act on. And it
seems out of the question to believe that he would
be away down here. You probably did see a
man with a crooked nose, Bob, but there are lots
such.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it was the same one we saw in Cresville,”
insisted the stout lad. “Come on, let’s
have a look down that road. We’ve got time.”</p>

<p>But they had not, for just then the order came
to fall in, and the march was resumed. But it was
only a short hike to the place where camp was to
be made for the night, and when Bob found that
it was not more than two miles to the road down
which he had seen the wagon turn, he said to his
chums:</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, we’ve got to investigate this.”</p>

<p>“Investigate what?” asked Jerry, shifting his
pack to ease a lame spot on one shoulder.</p>

<p>“Crooked Nose,” replied Bob. “We can ask
for a little time off, and take a hike by ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
down this road. Maybe that fellow works on a
farm around here. Though what he’s doing so
far from Cresville gets me. I’ll wager it isn’t
for any good. But we ought to look him up.”</p>

<p>“S’pose we find he’s the wrong man, even if he
has a crooked nose?” asked Ned, not eager for
further hiking just then.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take that chance,” Bob went on.
“I’m sure, from the look I had of him, that he’s
the same one. Are you with me?”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t ask that,” was Jerry’s answer.
“Of course we’re with you. And if this
turns out a fizzle we won’t say we told you so,
Chunky. It’s worth taking a chance on, though
if we do find this is the same crooked-nosed chap
we saw at the time of the fire, it isn’t going to
prove that he robbed the Frenchman. If he got
all that valuable stuff he wouldn’t be here—he’d
be in the city having a good time.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to be careful about making an accusation,
I guess,” agreed the stout lad. “But if
we find he <em>is</em> the same chap we saw we could telegraph
to the police of Cresville and ask if he was
wanted there. If he is, the police there could
take the matter up with the police of this place.
That’s the way they do it.”</p>

<p>“Are there any police here?” asked Ned, looking
around with a smile, for they were in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of a country that looked too peaceful to need officers
of the law.</p>

<p>“Oh, they always have constables, deputy sheriffs
or something in these villages,” said Jerry.
“That part will be all right, Bob. Go to it.”</p>

<p>And “go to it” Bob did. As soon as the army
had come to a stop and the supper mess had been
served, the three motor boys sought and received
permission to go off for a stroll. It was early
evening, and they must be back within the guard
lines at ten, they were told, but this would give
them time enough.</p>

<p>Having traveled about as much as they had,
the three friends had acquired a good general
sense of direction, and they had noted the location
of the highway down which Bob had said the
crooked-nosed man had driven.</p>

<p>It was their plan to go back to this point and
make some inquiries of any resident they might
meet in regard to the existence, on some neighboring
farm, of a man with a nose decidedly out of
joint.</p>

<p>“His defect is such that it surely will have been
noticed,” said Bob. “He’s a marked man if ever
there was one, and he ought to be easy to trace.”</p>

<p>As the three friends left the camp, armed with
written permission to be absent until “taps” that
night, Jerry, looking across the field, where the
dog tents were already up, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“There goes Pug Kennedy. He must have a
pass, too, for he’s going toward the lines.”</p>

<p>“I hope he isn’t going to trail us,” remarked
Bob. “If we make this capture, or give information
by which Crooked Nose is caught, we want
the honor ourselves,” he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pug doesn’t know anything about the Cresville
fire,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“He might,” insisted Bob. “He lives just outside
the town, and he may have heard of the
Frenchman’s loss and about Crooked Nose.
Come on, let’s get going, and not have him ahead
of us.”</p>

<p>But Pug Kennedy did not seem to be paying any
attention to the motor boys. He marched steadily
on, showed his pass to the sentry, and was allowed
to go through the line. Then he started
off down the road.</p>

<p>“That’s the way we’re going,” objected Bob,
in disappointed tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t pay any attention to him!” exclaimed
Jerry. “He’s probably going out to see if he
can pick up any more hens. We’ll mind our own
affairs, and he can mind his.”</p>

<p>“If he only will,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>However there was nothing to do but proceed
with the plan they had made. Whether it would
succeed or not was a question, and there was also
a question as to what to do in case they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
discover the right crooked-nosed man. But, being
youths of good spirits, the boys did not worry
much about this end of the affair.</p>

<p>Down the pleasant country road they marched,
in the early twilight. It would not be dark for
a while yet, and they expected to make good use
of their time. Their first “objective,” as Bob
said, would be the road down which the crooked-nosed
man had driven.</p>

<p>This place was soon reached, but it proved to
be a lonely stretch of highway. At least no house
was in sight, and there appeared to be no residents
of whom information could be asked.</p>

<p>“But there may be a house just around the turn
of the road,” suggested Bob hopefully. “Let’s
hike on.”</p>

<p>So go on they did, and they were rewarded by
seeing, as they made the turn in the highway, a
farmhouse about a quarter of a mile beyond.</p>

<p>“Maybe he lives there, or works there,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“What gets me, though, Chunky,” said Jerry,
“is what he would be doing down here.”</p>

<p>“Nothing strange in it,” said the stout lad. “He
may be a sort of tramp farmer, and they go all
over, the same as the umbrella men, or the wash-boiler
fixers. Come on!”</p>

<p>They hurried forward, eager for what lay
ahead of them, and if they had not been so eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they might have been aware of a figure which had
cut across lots and was sneaking along behind
them. And the figure was that of Pug Kennedy.</p>

<p>“I wonder what their game is?” Pug muttered
to himself. “If they are spying on me, it won’t
be healthy for them. I’ll see what they’re up to,
and maybe I can put a spoke in their wheel.”</p>

<p>Reaching the house, Ned, Bob and Jerry saw,
sitting out in front, evidently resting after his
day’s labors, a bronzed farmer. He looked at
the boys with interest, and inquired:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Lost your way?”</p>

<p>“No, we came to see you,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“To see me? Well, I’m sure I’m glad to see
any of Uncle Sam’s boys. Used to be one myself,
but that’s long ago. Come in and set.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re on business,” went on Jerry, who
had been elected spokesman. “Have you seen a
man around these parts with a very crooked
nose?”</p>

<p>The farmer started, and looked closely at the
boys.</p>

<p>“A crooked nose?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” interjected Bob, “a <em>very</em> crooked nose.
It’s spread all over one side of his face.”</p>

<p>“Why, that must be Jim Waydell! At least
that’s what he called himself when he came to
work for me,” said the farmer, who had given his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
name as Thomas Martin to the boys, when they
told him who they were.</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, not very much, no. He came along,
asked for work, and, as I was short-handed, I
gave it to him. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“We’re not sure whether he’s the man we want
to see or not,” answered Jerry, determined to be
a bit cautious. “If we could have a look at him
close by——”</p>

<p>“He’s out in the barn now,” interrupted the
farmer. “Go talk to him, if you like.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward a ramshackle red
building, and the three boys started toward it.
As they entered they heard some one moving
around, and then they caught sight of the very
man they were looking for standing in the opened
rear door. The last rays of the setting sun
streamed full in on him from behind, and illuminated
his face. His crooked nose was very much
in evidence.</p>

<p>“There he is!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>And as if the words were a warning the man,
with a cry, gave a jump up into the haymow and
disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned. “We’ll get him!”</p>

<p>The three motor boys sprang to the pursuit,
scrambling over the hay. It was a noiseless chase,
for the hay deadened all sounds. They could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
see the man, but it was evident that he was either
going to hide, or was making toward some unseen
door by which he could escape.</p>

<p>“We’ll get him!” exclaimed Bob. “Come on!”</p>

<p>There came a cry from Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Slipped and stuck my hand into a hen’s nest
in the hay,” was the answer. “Broke about half
a dozen eggs, I guess! Too bad! We might
have taken ’em back to camp to fry for breakfast.”</p>

<p>Hardly had Ned uttered the words than the
boys were startled by hearing a voice they knew—the
voice of Pug Kennedy. It said:</p>

<p>“There they are now, Mister, stealing your
eggs! I told you that’s what they were after—robbing
hens’ nests. Better look out for your
eggs!”</p>

<p>“I will!” exclaimed the voice of the farmer,
in answer to this accusation. “I wondered at
their story of the crooked-nosed man! They just
wanted to get into my barn! I’ll fix ’em!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE MINSTREL SHOW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, hearing this talk, wondered
greatly. What could it mean?</p>

<p>“Come down out of there!” cried Mr. Martin.
“Come down out of my haymow, and tell me what
you mean! What are you after, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“We want to catch that crooked-nosed man,”
answered Jerry. “We didn’t tell you before, but
we think he is a thief.”</p>

<p>“Well, I come pretty near <em>knowing</em> you are!”
was the grim retort. “Come down here!”</p>

<p>There was no choice but to obey, and rather
puzzled as to what it all meant, and why Pug
Kennedy should come to make such an accusation,
the three chums slid to the barn floor from the
haymow. They might miss their chance of catching
the crooked-nosed man, but it could not be
helped.</p>

<p>“There! What’d I tell you?” exclaimed Pug,
pointing to Ned, as the chums faced the now angry
farmer. “If those aren’t egg stains I’ll never
eat another bit of chow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Too late Ned realized what his accidental slipping
into the hen’s nest meant. The evidence was
damaging against him. The whites and yolks of
the eggs dripped from his hands, and there were
stains on his uniform.</p>

<p>“Ha! Caught you, didn’t I?” exclaimed the
farmer. “Now you’ll pay for this!”</p>

<p>“We’re perfectly willing to pay for the damage
we accidentally did to your eggs,” answered Ned.
“I believe I broke half a dozen, possibly more.
But it was while I was crawling around, trying to
get the crooked-nosed man, who was escaping.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good story, but it won’t wash,” laughed
Pug Kennedy. “They were after your eggs,
farmer, and that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, and I’m much obliged to you
for telling me. It isn’t the first time I’ve been
robbed by soldiers out on a hike, and I said the
next time it happened I’d complain. I’m going
to. You’ll come with me before your officers, and
see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry.
“We admit we broke some of your eggs by accident,
and we’re willing to pay, and pay well for
them. We didn’t intend to steal!”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” chimed in Ned, wiping his
hands off on some hay.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you might do,” was the answer.
“I only know what I see—egg stains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
You might have sneaked into the barn if I hadn’t
seen you. And when I did notice you, you told
me some story about a crooked-nosed man to make
it sound natural.”</p>

<p>“But there is a crooked-nosed man,” insisted
Bob.</p>

<p>“Course there is,” said the farmer. “I admit
that. But he isn’t such an unusual man. For all
I know you may have seen him driving in with my
wagon—he’d been to town—and you made up
that story about wanting to see him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we did see him driving,” admitted Bob.
“And then we thought——”</p>

<p>He stopped. He realized that appearances
were against him and his chums, and that any explanation
they might make, especially after Ned’s
mishap with the eggs, would seem strange.</p>

<p>“First I thought you were all right, and really
did want to see my hired man,” went on the
farmer. “But when this other soldier came and
said he’d seen you go into my barn, and had heard
you talking about getting eggs for a good feed,
why, I realized what you were up to.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you that yarn about us?” asked
Jerry, looking at Pug.</p>

<p>“He did. And it’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t the truth, and he knows it!” cried
Ned. “He’s taking this means of getting even because
of what he thinks we did to him. All right!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Let it go at that. We’ll go before the officers
with you. We’re not afraid! We’ll tell the
truth.”</p>

<p>“You’d better!” declared Mr. Martin. “You
wait till I hitch up and I’ll take you back to camp.
This soldierin’ business is all right, and I’m in
full sympathy with it. But it isn’t right to rob
farmers, and your officers won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t intend to rob you,” said Jerry.
“And while you are acting this way that man, who
may be a desperate criminal, is escaping. If you
are bound to take us before our officers, at least
look after the crooked-nosed chap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can lay hands on him when I want him,”
said the farmer, and then Ned, Bob and Jerry
realized how futile it was to argue with him.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” murmured Bob, as they drove
back to the camp in the wagon, Pug declining to
accompany them, saying he would walk.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is tough,” agreed Jerry. “Just when
we were about to get hold of Crooked Nose! If
he’s the one you think he is, Bob, he’ll take the
alarm and skip.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m afraid of. Hang Pug, anyhow!
What’s his game?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he made the accusation against us to
cover up some trick of his own,” suggested Ned,
in a low voice so the now unfriendly farmer
would not hear. “Pug had some object in coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
away from camp, and it wasn’t to follow us,
for he didn’t know what we were going to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he did,” assented Jerry. “But
he must have followed us, and when he saw us go
into the barn he made up his mean mind to make
trouble for us.”</p>

<p>This was the only explanation the boys could
think of, and they had to let it go at that.</p>

<p>The three chums had to stand no little chaffing
and gibing when they were brought back to camp
in practical custody of the farmer. It was not
uncommon for the lads, on hikes and practice
marches, to raid orchards and hen roosts, and
punishment was always meted out to the offenders,
while payment for the damage done was taken
from their pay, and their comrades jumped to this
as the explanation of the present predicament of
Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>“But this accusation is unjust!” said Ned, when
they were taken before their captain. “It’s all a
mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hear about it,” said the officer
somewhat wearily, for there had been several
cases of raids on this march.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Martin told his story of having
been informed by Kennedy of the alleged intentions
of the motor boys. And he told of having
seen them slide down from his haymow, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of them bearing unmistakable evidence of eggs
on his person.</p>

<p>“I know it looks queer,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“It certainly does,” agreed the captain, grimly.</p>

<p>But he was a just man and he listened to the
boys’ story. He seemed somewhat surprised at
the mention of the crooked-nosed man, but he
made no comment, and when all was said he gave
his judgment.</p>

<p>It was to the effect that as the boys had affirmed
on their honor as soldiers and gentlemen that they
were telling the truth, he could not but believe
them. At the same time it was evident that they
had done some slight damage, and had put the
farmer to some inconvenience in bringing them
back to camp, and it was only fair that they
should pay. Having already offered to make
payment, they were very willing to do this.</p>

<p>So the incident was ended, and the farmer,
convinced that he was in the right, and jingling
in his pocket a good price for the broken eggs,
went back to his home.</p>

<p>So, much to their regret, the boys lost trace of
Crooked Nose, or Jim Waydell, as the farmer
had called him. They could not look for the
suspect again that night, and the next morning they
had to march away with their comrades.</p>

<p>“But when we get back to camp we’ll take a day
or so off on furlough and come back here and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
if we can land him,” declared Bob. “We’re not
sure enough of his identity, on such casual glances,
to cause his arrest on mere information. We’ve
got to get him ourselves and find out more about
him.”</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” said Jerry, heartily.</p>

<p>The practice march was a success from a military
standpoint, though it showed up some weak
spots in the organization. But that was one of
the objects.</p>

<p>For several days after the return of the army
there were light drills to enable the boys to recover
from the strenuous exercise. Then one evening
Bob, in a state of some excitement, came
hurrying into the Y. M. C. A. quarters, looking
for Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” they asked. “Have you
seen Crooked Nose again?”</p>

<p>“No, but our company’s going to give a minstrel
show, and the committee has asked me if we
three will take part in it.”</p>

<p>“A minstrel show?” repeated Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, black up and everything!” exclaimed Bob.
“It’ll be fun! Let’s do it!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>A BLACK-FACE PURSUIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Life in the United States army is very nicely
balanced, at least in the big cantonments where
civilians are turned into soldiers in about six
months’ time.</p>

<p>That is to say there is a well-balanced schedule,
so much work and so much play. Reading the
schedule of what is required in the way of drill
would lead one to suppose that there was no time
for play at all, but there is, even on the French
front, with grim No Man’s Land staring one in
the face. Shows and plays are sometimes given
within sound of the big guns.</p>

<p>The officers in charge of the men well knew
that “all work and no play makes Jack,” not only
a dull boy, but a poor soldier. So recreation is
planned for. Part of this plan is to let the young
fellows amuse themselves, make their own fun,
which sometimes is better than having it made by
others.</p>

<p>The captain of the company in which Ned,
Bob and Jerry lived, moved and had their being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had planned a minstrel show, as Bob had said.
On the cantonment grounds was a theater to which
professionals occasionally came from the cities to
give their services. Almost every night there
was a moving picture show.</p>

<p>“But this is to be different,” explained Bob, to
his listening chums. “Captain Trainer has found
out that there’s considerable talent in our
bunch——”</p>

<p>“Ahem! did you look at me?” asked Jerry, assuming
an air of importance.</p>

<p>“He pointed to me!” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“You’re both wrong! It was I—Macbeth—he
meant!” declaimed a lad with a deep and
resonant voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out and listen,” advised Bob. “This
is the game. The captain has found out there are
a lot of fellows in our company who have acted in
amateur theatricals, and there are a few professionals.
So he’s going to get up a minstrel show,
and let the other companies see what we can do.
There’ll be a little admission charged, and if we
make any money it will go into the company’s
fund to buy——”</p>

<p>“Grub!” some one cut in, and everybody
laughed, for by this time all knew Bob’s weak
point.</p>

<p>“Well, grub, if you like,” he admitted. “But
say, fellows, won’t it be great?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p>And then the boys fell to talking about the coming
minstrel show.</p>

<p>Preparations for it went on apace. Captain
Trainer was an enthusiast, and when he set out
to do a thing he carried it to a finish. It was that
way with the minstrel show.</p>

<p>A good many “try-outs” and much practice
work were necessary. Then, after a deal of
weeding work, like that which a careful gardener
gives his plants, a very good show was evolved.</p>

<p>It took pattern after the usual black-face affairs,
with end-men, bones, tambourines, the interlocutor
and specialists. Some of the lads were
very clever, and really were almost as good as
professionals. Ned, Bob and Jerry were called
on to state what they could do, and when it was
found that they had a comic-song trio “up their
sleeves,” they were put down for that.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a hit all right,” declared Bob,
after one of the rehearsals.</p>

<p>“If we don’t get hit ourselves,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Ned. “I understand
there is a premium on old cabbage stumps and
other articles of that nature.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him scare you, Jerry,” advised the
stout lad. “He’s only afraid of that high note of
his. But don’t worry, Ned. We’ll cover you up
if you make a break!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh! I like your nerve. Now come on, let’s
try that jazz song over again,” which they did, to
the delight of those privileged to listen to the
try-out.</p>

<p>In the camp was a professional who showed the
boys how to make up with grease paint; burnt
cork, the time-honored method of making a
black-faced comedian, is now only used by boys
when they play in the barn. On the stage, even
for amateurs, black grease paint is used.</p>

<p>“Say, you look just like a negro!” exclaimed
Bob to Jerry, as they were getting dressed in the
evening before the show was to be given. “You’ve
even got the walk down pat.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve been practicing a bit,” Jerry admitted.
“If you’re going to do a thing, do it right,
I say. You’re not bad yourself, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, my figure is against me. But I guess
we’ll make out all right.”</p>

<p>Indeed the three motor boys were taking special
pains with their appearance. That is not to
say the other actors were not also, but Ned, Bob,
and Jerry seemed to enter into the spirit of it more
than some of their chums.</p>

<p>The various acts came off as planned, and were
much appreciated by the audience. There were
many local hits and take-offs, not only on the enlisted
men, but on the officers as well. Mild fun
was poked at the different weaknesses of many in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the ranks, and not a few of those higher up, and
considerable laughter resulted.</p>

<p>The three Cresville friends did their act so
well that they were recalled again and again, and
if they had not prepared something for encores,
which Jerry had insisted on, they might have had
merely to bow their thanks. As it was they sang
verse after verse of a comical song, bringing in
all their friends, to the great delight of the latter.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have done better, boys,” complimented
Captain Trainer, as Ned, Bob, and
Jerry came off the stage for the last time. “I’m
glad you’re with us. When we get over on the
other side I hope you’ll still keep up your spirits
enough to give us some enjoyment, when we’ll need
it more than we do here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best,” said Jerry modestly.</p>

<p>“You’d think they were a bunch of professionals
to hear them talk,” came a low, sneering voice to
the ears of the three chums, when the captain
walked away. There was no need to ask who
had spoken. It was Pug Kennedy, and he was
standing just outside the dressing room, talking
to one or two of his special cronies. He did not
have many associates. His “scrappy” nature prevented
this.</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to go over and give him a
punch,” declared Ned, angrily. “He’s made too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
many of those uncalled-for remarks of late. I’m
not going to stand it!”</p>

<p>“Don’t start a row now,” advised Jerry. “It
will spoil all the fun. Let him alone. I heard
something to the effect that he was going to apply
for a transfer, and if he does he won’t bother us
any more.”</p>

<p>“I hope to goodness he does,” said Bob. “He
makes me tired!”</p>

<p>Pug gazed over in the direction of the three
friends, almost as if inviting trouble, and then,
seeing that they were not going to resent the remark
he had made with the intention that they
should hear it, he lighted a cigarette and strolled
out into the darkness. Discipline was somewhat
relaxed on account of the minstrel show, and permission
was given for the men to remain up an
hour later than usual, while the guard lines were
extended to allow considerable strolling about.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s go for a walk,” suggested Bob.
“It will cool us off.”</p>

<p>“What, walk with this black stuff on our faces?”
exclaimed Ned. “If any one sees us we’ll be
taken for negroes.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Jerry. “Every one knows
what’s going on. Besides, we can’t wash up yet.
We have to go on in the final chorus in about an
hour. I’m with you, Bob! We’ll take a walk
and cool off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>They strolled through the camp, and presently
found themselves near its outskirts. They had
plenty of time, as they had finished their special
part of the programme, and only came on in the
grand “wind-up.”</p>

<p>As they were walking along, talking intermittently
of the show and the chances of going “over
there,” Bob, who was slightly in the lead, called
in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Look, fellows! See him!”</p>

<p>“See who?” asked Ned. “Do you mean Pug
Kennedy?”</p>

<p>“No, but look over under that light!” went on
Bob, pointing. “Don’t you see that man. It’s
Crooked Nose again! Come on! We’ll get him
this time!” and he started to run, followed by
Ned and Jerry, who did, indeed, see in the glare
of a camp light, the form of a man. And, as he
momentarily turned his face toward them, they
saw that his countenance was marred by a bent
and crooked nose.</p>

<p>The boys gave pursuit, their faces still blackened.</p>

<small>“A PRISONER”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What’s he doing here?”</p>

<p>“Where’s he going?”</p>

<p>“Did he see us?”</p>

<p>These were the questions asked in turn by Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, as they slipped along in the
darkness, following the man with the crooked
nose, whom they had so unexpectedly seen.</p>

<p>“Maybe he came to laugh at us for the way the
tables were turned on us, the time we tried to
catch him in the farmer’s barn,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’s come a long distance out of his way for
a little thing like that,” commented Ned. “I’m
inclined to think he came here to meet some one.
After Bob spoke I saw the fellow look at his
watch as though impatient because of an appointment
not kept.”</p>

<p>“Well, where’s he going now?” asked Bob, repeating
his question.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s up to us to find out,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s trying to lead us into an ambush,”
suggested Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cut out the dime-novel stuff,” advised Jerry,
with a low laugh. “I’ve got a better explanation
than that, and the real one.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s our black faces,” returned the tall chum.
“If that crooked-nosed man—Jim Waydell the
farmer called him, though it may not be his right
name—if he saw us at all, which he probably did,
he takes us for negroes. That’s why he isn’t
worried. He thinks we’re camp roustabouts, and
that we don’t know anything about him.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right!” exclaimed Ned, after
a moment’s thought. “We do look like a trio of
colored chaps, and that’s why he isn’t getting worried
and taking it on the run. Say, it’s a lucky
thing we are this way.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” assented Jerry. “Now mind your
talk. Do the negro dialect as well as you can,
fellows, and we may find out something about this
mysterious Crooked Nose. If we can bring about
his arrest for robbing the Frenchman, or for setting
the fire, which Mr. Cardon seemed to think he
did, it will be a good thing for us and Cresville.
So pretend we are colored men with a few hours
off.”</p>

<p>The boys walked as near as they thought safe
to the solitary suspect, who was trudging down
the road alone. When they spoke aloud the
motor boys simulated the broad negro tones, talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and laughing as they had often heard the camp
teamsters and servants do, for the place was overrun
with good-natured, if rather shiftless, colored
men.</p>

<p>As for “Mr. Crooked Nose,” as the boys sometimes
called him, he seemed to pay little attention
to those who were following him. Either he took
them for genuine colored men, and, as such, persons
who could have no interest in his movements,
or he was indifferent to the fact that they might
be some of the minstrel players.</p>

<p>What the man’s object was in coming to camp,
when the farm on which he was supposed to work
was several miles away, could only be guessed at.
But the boys hoped to find it out.</p>

<p>They were approaching the camp confines, and
were debating whether they could risk going beyond
them, when the crooked-nosed man turned
into a field, and made his way toward a deserted
barn. This was one that had been on a farm
when the land had been taken by the government
for Camp Dixton.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s going to sleep there,” suggested
Bob. “Or perhaps he is going to meet some one
there.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” advised Jerry. “We’ll walk on
down the road, as if we didn’t care what he did.
Then we’ll circle back and sneak up to the barn.
Maybe we can find out something about him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Strike up a song, so he’ll think we’re what we pretend
to be.”</p>

<p>They began humming the chorus of one of the
songs they had sung in the minstrel show, and so
passed on down the road. There was a moon,
and the movements of the crooked-nosed man
could easily be observed. He struck off across
the vacant lots toward the barn, not even looking
back at the singing boys, who did, indeed, have the
appearance of negroes.</p>

<p>Proceeding far enough beyond a turn of the
road to be hidden from sight, Ned, Bob, and Jerry
waited a few minutes, and then turned back.
This time they did not sing, and they talked only
in whispers.</p>

<p>Cautiously they approached the barn, looking
for any sign of a light or any movement that
would indicate the presence of the mysterious man
or of a person who had come there to meet him,
or with whom he had expected to keep a rendezvous.</p>

<p>“‘All quiet along the Potomac,’” quoted Bob,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Well, have it quiet here, too,” whispered Jerry.
“We may discover something, and we may not.
But there’s no use in giving ourselves away. He
may get angry if he finds we’re not what we seem
to be, and knows that we’ve been following him.
Go easy now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The young soldiers finally stood in the shadow
of the barn and listened intently. At first they
heard nothing but the rattle and flap of some loose
pieces of wood.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“Listen!” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke they all heard the low murmur
of voices. And the voices were those of men.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get nearer, where we can hear
better,” whispered Jerry to his chums. “It’s
around this way.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the side of the barn that was
in the deepest shadow, and presently they came to
a stop below a small window. The glass had
been broken out of it, and through the aperture
came the tones of the voices more distinctly. One
said:</p>

<p>“When did he say he was coming?”</p>

<p>“He promised to be here to-night,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Of course the boys, not having heard the
crooked-nosed man’s voice, did not know which
was his, nor which was his companion’s.</p>

<p>“To-night; eh?” came in sharp tones. “Well,
he didn’t come, and you tell him I want to see
him, and see him bad. I’m tired of hanging
around here without any money, and I’m working
like a dog on that farm.”</p>

<p>“That’s Crooked Nose,” whispered Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell him,” said the other voice. “I
don’t know what’s got into him lately. But he
and Pug have some game on and——”</p>

<p>The voice died out into an indistinguishable
murmur.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” demanded Ned, and his
voice was so sharp that Jerry clapped a hand over
his friend’s lips.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” he cautioned.</p>

<p>They listened, but the voices were no longer
heard. Instead came the sound of feet tramping
on bare boards.</p>

<p>“They’re going away,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s stay here and see what happens,” suggested
Ned. “I’d like to know who that other
man is. Maybe there’s spy work going on in
our camp!”</p>

<p>It was within the bounds of possibility.</p>

<p>Waiting in the shadows, the motor boys heard
the footsteps die away. Then the murmur of
voices sounded again. They came nearer, and
indicated that those who were talking were outside
the barn.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell him you want to see him,” said
the man who was with the crooked-nosed fellow.</p>

<p>“You’d better! He can have all the games
he wants with Pug, but he’s got to make a settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with me. I took all the risk, and he got all
the money. I want my share!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him!”</p>

<p>“And now about this storehouse business,”
went on the other. “Can you get into it?”</p>

<p>“I have an extra key. And Kratzler——”</p>

<p>“No names!” warned the other quickly. “You
can’t tell who may be sneaking about. Nix on
the names!”</p>

<p>Then the voices died away again, and the boys,
listening, could hear nothing more.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong going on here!” decided
Ned. “Did you hear Pug’s name mentioned
twice?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Jerry. “But it may not be the
one we know.”</p>

<p>“I believe it is,” went on Ned. “We’ve got
to find out more about this. There they go!”</p>

<p>He pointed to two figures, dimly seen. They
were moving rapidly away across the field.</p>

<p>“Come on!” exclaimed Ned, in a tense whisper.</p>

<p>Just then in the distance, two shots rang out.</p>

<p>“That’s the signal!” cried Jerry. “They’re
ending the sketch ‘The Sentry’s Last Challenge.’
We go on right after that in the final chorus.
We’ve got about five minutes to make it. Come
on! Hike!”</p>

<p>“But what about these fellows?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to let them go,” decided Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“We can’t afford to spoil the minstrel show for
the sake of something that may not amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>“Not even to catch Crooked Nose?” asked Bob,
in disappointed tones.</p>

<p>“We’ll take up his case later,” said Jerry.
“Just now we’re minstrels. Come on.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do, and though the
boys wanted to remain and, if possible, solve the
mystery, they felt that they owed it to Captain
Trainer to make the minstrel show a success.
They had important parts, and the shots they had
heard fired were blank cartridges, discharged during
the enactment of a little skit, played by some
members of their company.</p>

<p>The two men had disappeared in the shadows,
and it was a question whether the boys could have
spied on them to any further advantage that
night. So they hurried back, arriving just in time
to take part in the last chorus.</p>

<p>After the show, which was voted a big success,
the boys debated among themselves whether they
should report what they had seen and heard and
mention Pug Kennedy’s name. Also they talked
of the time when they had seen Pug have a midnight
meeting with some one.</p>

<p>“There was more in that than appeared on the
surface,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you,” said Jerry. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
there’s something in this affair to-night, too. But
we don’t know enough to cause more than suspicions,
and there’s a chance that things would go
against us.”</p>

<p>“Then what are we to do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, I say, until we have more definite
information,” was the tall lad’s answer. “We
can make another attempt to find out more about
this crooked-nosed man.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” decided Ned. “Let’s
wait a bit.”</p>

<p>So they said nothing about having followed the
man to the barn, being able to get close to him
because he took them for negroes, and they bided
their time.</p>

<p>The minstrel show made a welcome break in
the monotony of camp life, and it acted like a
good tonic. The boys were the more ready to
take up the routine of work, and there was plenty
of it.</p>

<p>As they progressed in their soldier life Ned,
Bob and Jerry found it more interesting. The
need of the various drills began to be better understood.
They liked the work on the rifle ranges,
the machine gun exercises and the trench work.
They went on several other hikes, and at times
were given charge of some new squads of drafted
men who came to camp.</p>

<p>It was about two weeks after the minstrel show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that Jerry, Bob and Ned were all out on guard
together when they heard the man on the post next
to Jerry’s calling:</p>

<p>“Corporal of the guard!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry, as he sent
the call down the line.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a prisoner!” was the answer. “I
caught him trying to get in through the lines! I
guess he’s a German spy!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the crooked-nosed man!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Or the one who was with him in the barn,”
added Ned.</p>

<p>“Or the one they spoke of as going into some
game with Pug,” said Jerry. “Come on! We’d
better go help Kelly.” Kelly was the name of the
sentry who had called.</p>

<p>The three boys went off on a run in the darkness,
going to the aid of their comrade. Little
did they dream of the surprise in store for them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>A NIGHT ALARM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Corporal of the Guard! Post Number
Ten!”</p>

<p>This was the cry, in various intonations, that
went ringing down the line in the darkness. As
instructed, Ned, Bob and Jerry, being the nearest
to the place of the alarm, went to render what
aid might be necessary to the sentry who had first
called. Meanwhile the corporal of the guard,
rousing those whose duty it was to go out with
him and see to the disturbance, was hastening to
the scene.</p>

<p>As Ned, Bob and Jerry approached they heard
some one saying:</p>

<p>“But I must have it! I tell you I must get it.
It is exceedingly valuable, and you ought not to
stop me.”</p>

<p>“Stop you! I’ve stopped you all right!” came
the vigorous tones of Kelly, the sentry.</p>

<p>“But I must get through. I must!”</p>

<p>“And I say you must not! Trying to run the
guard under my very nose; that’s what you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
trying to do. But I caught you! You’re a German
spy—that’s what you are!”</p>

<p>“No, I assure you that you are mistaken,” came
a gentle voice in answer. “I am only after some
new specimens——”</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry gave a shout.</p>

<p>“It’s him, all right!” cried Jerry, enthusiastically
if not grammatically.</p>

<p>“I thought it sounded like him,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Hello, Professor Snodgrass!” called Bob.
“It’s all right. Keep quiet. We’ll be with you
in a minute!”</p>

<p>They raced up to the excited sentry, who stood
holding a small, bald-headed man, at the same
time flashing in his face a pocket electric lamp.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, boys, is it?” asked the little man,
who did not seem at all disturbed by the situation
in which he found himself. “Well, I’m glad
to see you. I just arrived, getting in rather late
on account of a delayed train. I walked over,
intending to visit you. I had no idea it was so
late, but I am glad it is, for I have just seen some
specimens of moth that only fly about this hour.
I wanted to catch some but—er—this gentleman——”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, for it was he, paused and
looked at his captor.</p>

<p>“You’re right! I wouldn’t let you go chasin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
through the lines!” exclaimed Kelly. “Do you
know him?” he asked the motor boys.</p>

<p>“He is a friend of ours,” declared Jerry.
“We know him well. He is Professor Uriah
Snodgrass, of Boxwood Hall, and what he says is
true—he does collect moths and other bugs.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ cats!” cried Kelly. “And I took him
for a German spy! I beg your pardon,” he went
on. “My father was a professor in Dublin University,
and I’m sorry I disturbed you. I’ll help
you collect bugs when I’m off duty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Professor Snodgrass, as if
it was the most natural thing in the world to get
offers of assistance in this way. “I shall be glad
of help. Ha! There is one of the late-flying
moths now!” and he reached over and made a
grab for something on the shoulder of the corporal
of the guard, who had come running up.</p>

<p>“Here! None of that! What’s the idea!
Disarm him!” cried the corporal, who was hardly
awake yet. “Has he bombs on him?” he asked
of Kelly.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s all a mistake,” the sentry replied.
“I was patrolling my post, when I saw some one
walking along, and seemingly picking things up
off the ground. Or maybe, I thought, he was
planting infernal machines. So I rushed over and
grabbed him, and I yelled and——”</p>

<p>“I was only gathering bugs by the light of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
little electric lamp,” the professor explained. “I
had no idea I was so near the army camp, though
I intended to visit it to see my friends,” and he
motioned to the motor boys. With his usual
absent-mindedness he had forgotten all about
everything but what he saw immediately before
him—the bugs and the night moths.</p>

<p>“Do you know this gentleman?” asked the corporal
of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a very good friend of ours.”</p>

<p>“Then you may release him,” went on the corporal
to Kelly. “And we are sorry for what happened.”</p>

<p>But it is doubtful if Professor Snodgrass heard
him, for the little scientist was again reaching
forward to get something from the shoulder of
the corporal. This time he succeeded, and those
gathered about had a glimpse of a white, fluttering
object.</p>

<p>“One of the finest and largest white moths I
have ever caught!” exclaimed the delighted professor.
“I thank you!” he added, as though the
corporal had done him a great favor by serving
as a perch for the insect.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by the capture of the
“prisoner” soon passed, and the corporal went
back to his rest, while Ned, Bob and Jerry, whose
tour of duty was up, took Professor Snodgrass in
charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>They explained the matter to the officer in
charge of their barracks, and a spare bunk was
found for the college instructor.</p>

<p>But he did not seem inclined to use it. He
wanted to sit up and enter in his note book something
about the specimens he had caught in such a
sensational manner, but when it was explained to
him that to have lights in an army camp after
ten o’clock was against the regulations, except in
cases of emergency, he put out his pocket electric
lantern and dutifully went to sleep, with his specimen
boxes under his bed.</p>

<p>The next day Professor Snodgrass told the boys
that so many students had enlisted from Boxwood
Hall that the teaching force was greatly reduced.</p>

<p>“I was given a leave of absence,” he added,
“and I decided to come to see you, and, at the
same time, make a study of Southern moths and
other insects. So I came on, getting in rather
late, as I mentioned.”</p>

<p>“We’re mighty glad to see you,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p>“How are things in Cresville?” asked Ned.
“Or didn’t you stop there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, as I wanted to get your exact
addresses. Matters are quiet. A number of the
boys have enlisted, or been drafted, as you know,
but otherwise things are about the same, your
folks say.”</p>

<p>“Any more news about the fire?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, the ruins are still there, and I believe
that Frenchman—whose name I don’t recall—is
in much distress about the loss of his money.”</p>

<p>“And Crooked Nose has been here!” burst
out Bob. “We must try to nab him!”</p>

<p>He and his chums talked about the possibility
of this, but it is doubtful if Professor Snodgrass
heard, for, just then, a peculiar bug attracted his
attention, and he began to “stalk” it, as Ned remarked.</p>

<p>The boys enjoyed the visit of the little scientist,
and he took an interest in matters about Camp
Dixton; that is, when he was not collecting bugs,
in which occupation he spent most of his time.</p>

<p>It was on the night of Professor Snodgrass’
third day’s stay at the place where the soldier city
had sprung up. Some hours after Ned, Bob and
Jerry had gone to their bunks at the signal of taps,
they were awakened by an alarm.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! I’ve got him!” some one
shouted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE HAND GRENADE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Ned of Jerry, for
the sound of the alarm in the night had penetrated
to their barracks, and several had awakened.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! I’ve got him! He mustn’t get
away!” was shouted again, and then a glimmer of
the truth began to dawn on Jerry.</p>

<p>“Corporal of the guard, post number seven!”
was shouted from somewhere out on the fields
about the camp.</p>

<p>By this time all in the immediate vicinity of the
barracks, where Ned, Bob and Jerry had their
bunks, were aroused. Lights were set aglow, and
Ned, looking over to a bed which had been temporarily
placed for Professor Snodgrass, cried:</p>

<p>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I guess he’s the one who’s got
him!” added Jerry with a laugh. “I think it was
his voice that caused the disturbance. Perhaps
we’d better go out and see what it all is. If it’s
some one who doesn’t know the professor they
might take him for a spy, and use him roughly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who do you suppose he’s caught?” asked Bob.
“Do you think it can be Crooked Nose or one of
his cronies?”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine it’s anything as dramatic as
that,” returned Jerry. “I rather think the professor
has been bug-hunting again, and he has
found his quarry most unexpectedly, which has
caused his jubilation.”</p>

<p>And this they found to be true. When they
had slipped on a few garments and their shoes
and had gone outside, they found Professor Snodgrass
walking along between two sentries. On the
faces of the soldiers were puzzled looks, but on
that of the little scientist was a gentle and satisfied
smile, as though the world had used him very well
indeed.</p>

<p>“I have it, boys!” he exclaimed, as he caught
sight of his three friends. “It is one of the rarest
of its kind. I caught it——”</p>

<p>“He caught it on my post, whatever it is,” said
one of the sentries. “And he nearly scared my
supper out of me. Talk about snakes! I’d
rather see ’em any night!”</p>

<p>“What did you find?” asked Jerry of the professor.</p>

<p>“A new kind of centipede,” was the answer, and
the professor showed, in a glass-topped box, a
horrible, many-legged insect that was squirming
around, trying to get out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, landy!” cried the sentry who had apprehended
the little scientist, peering into the box.
“And to think one of them was loose on my post!
Say, how long do you live after one bites you?”
he asked anxiously. “There might be more
where I have to walk, and if one nips me——”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Professor Snodgrass.
“The bite of this centipede, while it is painful,
is not deadly. Proper treatment will make you
safe. But this is a most wonderful specimen. I
had hoped to find one, but not so soon.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you discover anything else?”
asked an officer who had come out to see what the
excitement was about.</p>

<p>“Anything else? No, but I’ll keep on looking,
if you’ll let me. I may find a scorpion, though
I am a bit doubtful about finding them so far
north. However, I’m sure that just before I
caught the centipede I saw a number of giant
spiders with double stings. I’d like to look for
them, and——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Lieutenant!” exclaimed the sentry
who had caught the professor. “But would
you mind giving me another post? He found
all them animals he speaks of right here where I’m
patrollin’.” And the soldier looked more frightened
than if he had been told to charge on a battery
of machine guns.</p>

<p>“I mean you saw no unauthorized persons trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to get through the lines, did you?” asked the
lieutenant of the professor. “The insects were
all you found?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I haven’t found enough,” answered
the scientist. “I should like more time. I
couldn’t sleep, so I got up to hunt for specimens,
and I was most successful.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we shall have to ask you to postpone
your operations until morning,” said the
officer with a smile. “We want you to feel free
to advance the cause of science as much as you
can, but a war camp at night is a nervous sort of
place, and the least alarm disturbs a large number
of men.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Mr. Snodgrass. “I can, of
course, wait until it is light. There may be more
scorpions and centipedes out then.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I go off duty,” murmured the sentry.</p>

<p>Official explanations were then made. As he
had said, Professor Snodgrass had been unable to
sleep, and had arisen, without awakening the boys
or any of their comrades, and had gone outside
the barracks with his electric flash light and his
collection boxes.</p>

<p>He had seen the centipede wiggling along in
the sand, and had caught it, his yells of delight,
announcing the fact, giving the alarm, and causing
the sentries to think a corporal’s guard of German
spies had descended on them. Two of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
made a rush for the professor, much to his surprise.
For when he was getting specimens he was
oblivious to his surroundings, thinking only of
what he was after.</p>

<p>The camp finally settled back to quietness again,
and the professor went with the boys back to the
barracks, but it was some time before any of them
got to sleep again.</p>

<p>The next day Professor Snodgrass found a
number of what he said were very rare and valuable
bugs from a collector’s standpoint, but which,
to the boys and their chums, seemed to be utterly
worthless and great pests, for most of them bit
or stung.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you don’t understand!” the scientist
would say, when objections were made to his
viewpoint.</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you catch bugs by daylight,
and don’t wake us up in the middle of the night,
we’ll forgive you,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Especially after disappointing us so,” added
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Disappoint?” queried the professor. “Why,
I couldn’t have asked for a better specimen of
centipede than the one I captured.”</p>

<p>They had a day’s furlough coming to them,
and they decided to use it, when it was granted, in
making a search for the crooked-nosed man. At
the same time they could enjoy an outing with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
professor, and watch him catch “bugs,” as the
boys called all his specimens, whether they were
horned toads or minute insects that needed a
microscope to distinguish them from the leaves on
which they fed.</p>

<p>“This will be like old times,” declared Bob, as
they started out one day after the morning mess,
the professor being a guest of Jerry’s company.</p>

<p>But though the expedition was a success from a
scientific standpoint, in that Professor Snodgrass
secured many new specimens, it was a failure as
far as the crooked-nosed man was concerned.
There was no trace of him at the old barn. In
fact the boys scarcely expected to find any there.
But they did hope to get some news of him from
Mr. Martin, the farmer who had so unjustly accused
the chums of taking eggs.</p>

<p>“But he isn’t here,” said that person, when the
boys had tramped out to his place and made inquiries.
Mr. Martin seemed somewhat ashamed
of the rôle he had played, and tried to make
amends.</p>

<p>“I guess you boys scared him away,” he said,
referring to the crooked-nosed man. “I don’t
know anything about him except that he said his
name was Jim Waydell, and he came along here,
asking for work. I sized him up as a sort of
tramp, but he was handy around the place, and,
as I needed a man, I took him on, though I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
like his looks. But I figured he couldn’t help
that. Anyhow he’s skipped, and I don’t know
where he is.”</p>

<p>That seemed to end the matter, though the boys
had hopes of coming across the crooked-nosed
man again.</p>

<p>“Not only would we like to get him on account
of the part he may have had in robbing the
Frenchman,” announced Jerry, “but I think he
and some others, including Pug Kennedy, are
mixed up in a plan to do some damage to the
camp. We don’t know enough to say anything
without getting laughed at, perhaps, but we may
be able to find out.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed the professor.
“Keep your eyes open. If I hadn’t done that I’d
never have caught the centipede.”</p>

<p>They returned to camp, and the next day Professor
Snodgrass had to leave. He was on his
way farther south, to visit a scientific friend, the
two expecting to go on a collecting trip together.</p>

<p>“I may stop and see you on my way north
again,” said the scientist. “If I hear anything of
the crooked-nosed man I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>Once again the boys took up the routine of
camp life. They were being made into good soldier
material, along with thousands of their chums
and comrades, and they were beginning to love the
life, hard as it was at times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>They drilled, and drilled, and drilled again;
<a href="#image01">they perfected themselves in the use of the rifle
and the bayonet</a>; and they received machine gun
instructions.</p>

<p>“What is it to be to-day?” asked Bob, as they
went out from the mess hall. “Do we hike or
shoot?”</p>

<p>“Hand grenade practice,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>There was a fascination in hurling the lemon-shaped
projectiles from trenches, and watching
them blow up the earth and stones beyond, where
some Germans were supposed to be hiding.</p>

<p>Hand grenades are of several kinds. That
used at Camp Dixton was a variation of the Mills
bomb, consisting of a hollow metal container,
shaped like a lemon, but somewhat larger. It is
made of cast iron and is crisscrossed and scored
with a number of depressed cuts, which divide the
surface of the grenade into lozenge-like sections.
The grenade is filled with a powerful explosive,
set off by a time fuse, and when the bomb detonates
it bursts into pieces, along the scored lines,
and the hundreds of lozenge-like pieces of iron
become so many bullets, flying in all directions.</p>

<p>The hand grenade is thrown with a motion such
as a cricketer uses in “bowling” the ball. It is
an overhand style of throwing, and this has been
found best for accuracy and does not tire the arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as much as a straight throw. The arm is held
stiff as the bomb is hurled.</p>

<p>The time fuse can be set to explode the bomb
as it reaches the other trench, or it may be made
to explode in mid-air, and, also, the detonation
can be made to take place after the bomb has
landed.</p>

<p>As long as the bomb is held in the hand it is
harmless, for the fingers press down on an outside
lever that controls the firing mechanism. But as
soon as this hold is released, after the bomb has
been made ready for firing, it is likely to explode.
Consequently after a bomb has been hurled away
from one, it is a good thing to keep one’s distance
from it.</p>

<p>“Lively work now, boys!” called the captain, as
Ned, Bob and Jerry, with their chums, entered
the trench for the hand grenade work. “Just
imagine there are a lot of Germans in that other
trench who need extermination.”</p>

<p>The practice began, and for a time one would
have thought a real battle was in progress, so
rapid were the explosions of the grenades. A
short distance down the trench, in which the Cresville
friends were, stood Pug Kennedy. They
had seen little of him during the last few days,
as, owing to an infraction of the rules, he had
spent some time in the guardhouse. But now he
was out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“This way of throwing these lemons makes me
tired!” exclaimed Pug. “Why can’t I throw one
like a baseball? I can make a better hit that
way, and I’m going to.”</p>

<p>Before any of his comrades could tell him not
to disobey orders this way, Pug suddenly threw a
bomb. In making the underhand toss, his elbow
struck the edge of the trench, the grenade left
his hand and fell a few feet away, directly in front
of a line of soldiers crouched in the depression.</p>

<p>“Now look what you did!” yelled the corporal
in charge of Pug’s squad. “That’ll go off in a
second or two!”</p>

<p>“Heads down, every one!” cried a lieutenant
who had seen what had happened.</p>

<p>The bomb, with the fuse set to explode it in a
short time, lay on the ground just outside the
trench that was filled with young soldiers. Pug’s
recklessness had endangered all their lives.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There had been several accidents in camp, and
just before Jerry, Bob and Ned had arrived two
men had been killed by the premature explosion
of a hand grenade. It was no wonder then, that,
as the young soldiers saw the instrument of death
so near them, and realized that in another moment
the missiles might be hurled among them, fear
clutched their hearts.</p>

<p>“Down! Down!” shouted the lieutenant
again, running along the wide trench, in crouching
fashion, to see that his command was enforced.
“Get down, every one!”</p>

<p>Only in this way could danger be in a measure
averted, and yet the explosion, so near at hand,
might cave in the trench, burying the boys.</p>

<p>Not more than a second or two had passed since
Pug, by his recklessness, had created the danger,
and yet it seemed like hours to some, as they gazed
with fascinated eyes at the bomb so near them.
It needed only a fraction more of time to bring
about the explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet in that fraction Jerry Hopkins acted.
Before any one was aware of his intention he had
leaped up on the firing step of the trench, and
was out, with a shovel in his hand.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” yelled the lieutenant.
“Come back! You’ll be killed! That
bomb’s going off!”</p>

<p>Jerry did not stop to answer. There was no
time. Neither was there time to argue over disobeying
one’s superior officer. Jerry knew he had
to act quickly, and he did.</p>

<p>With one scoop of his shovel he picked the
grenade up in it, and, with the same motion, he
sent the deadly missile hurtling over toward the
other trench, in which there were no soldiers stationed.</p>

<p>With all his strength, and as far as he could,
Jerry hurled the grenade, and it had no sooner
landed in the other trench, far enough away to be
harmless to the practicing squad, than it exploded.
Up in the air flew a shower of earth and stones, a
few particles reaching Jerry, who was out of the
trench, and some distance in advance of it.</p>

<p>For a moment after the echoes of the explosion
died away there was silence, and then came a
ringing and spontaneous cheer. The soldier lads
realized that Jerry had saved the lives of some of
them, and had prevented many from severe injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great work, my boy! Well done!” cried the
lieutenant, as Jerry dropped back into the trench,
and the officer shook hands with the tall lad.</p>

<p>“It was the only thing to do, that I could see,”
Jerry explained. “I didn’t want to pick the grenade
up in my hand, but I thought I could swing
it out of the way with the shovel.”</p>

<p>“And you certainly did,” the lieutenant said.
“As for you, Kennedy, I saw how you threw that
bomb. It was against orders. You have been
told to use the overhand swing, and because you
did not you dropped the grenade too close to the
trench. It was a violation of orders and a serious
one. You may consider yourself under arrest.”</p>

<p>Pug received only what was due him, but the
look he gave Jerry told that lad he might look
for some retaliation on the part of the bully.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d put him out of the army, or at
least transfer him to some other company,” said
Bob, when the practice was over. “He does
nothing but make trouble for us!”</p>

<p>And it did seem so, from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Jerry’s action was officially noted, and he received
public commendation from the captain for
his quick work in getting the grenade out of the
way.</p>

<p>Jerry’s action later received a more substantial
recognition than mere words, for he was made a
corporal, being the first of the trio to gain promotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
But Ned and Bob were glad, not jealous.</p>

<p>“Corporal, we salute you!” exclaimed Bob,
when Jerry was made a non-commissioned officer,
and Chunky and Ned formally gave Jerry the
recognition due him.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” advised Jerry—unofficially.
“I’m not going to be any different.”</p>

<p>But Jerry found that he had to be just a little
different. He was given charge of a squad of
seven men, including Bob and Ned, much to the
delight of the latter, and the young officer was
supposed to look after their welfare, in a way, and
also instruct them.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad Pug Kennedy isn’t any longer
in our squad,” Jerry said. “We can sort of keep
to ourselves now.”</p>

<p>As marching, next to actually firing shots at the
enemy, forms the principal work of a soldier,
there were many drills devoted to this work.
The uses of the different formations were explained
to the lads, and they were put through
many evolutions which seemed tiresome in themselves,
but which had certain objects in view.</p>

<p>Of course, on the battlefield, there is little
chance for such marching as is done on the drill
ground. But there is always distance to go, and
sometimes in the quickest possible time, so the soldiers
must be hardened to marching under the
most adverse circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>To this end many hikes, or practice marches,
were held. Sometimes the whole regiment, sometimes
only certain companies, and again only a
squad would be sent out.</p>

<p>It was one day, about two weeks after his promotion,
that Corporal Jerry Hopkins was ordered
to take his squad out for an all-day hike through
the country. They were to take their rations
with them, and spend the day marching about.</p>

<p>It was not an aimless march, though, for it had
an object. Jerry was ordered to bring back a
map of the route he took, marking the location of
houses, barns, wells, places where fodder might
be had for horses, sustenance for men, and the
location of the roads.</p>

<p>This work is constantly being done by the army,
so that the military officials will have complete
information about every part of our big country,
not only for use in times of peace, but in time of
war, should we ever be invaded by a foreign foe.</p>

<p>Behold then, early one morning, Ned, Bob and
Jerry, the latter in command, with four other men,
ready for the practice hike.</p>

<p>“You will use your discretion, Corporal,” Captain
Trainer had said to Jerry. “If an emergency
occurs, and you have to remain out all night, seek
the best shelter you can. You have your dog
tents, and you have rations enough until after
breakfast to-morrow. If you should need more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
you are empowered to requisition them, giving a
proper receipt for them, payment to be made
later.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>Jerry saluted and marched his men down the
road, not a little proud of his mission.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about the hike.
Hundreds of other squads had done the same
thing, and had brought back good maps. Jerry
wanted to do the same.</p>

<p>Everything went well. They reached their objective,
had supper, and camped for the night.
And then their troubles began. For no sooner
were they snug in their shelter tents than a violent
storm came up, with thunder and lightning, and
two of the tents, low as they were, blew over.</p>

<p>“Say, this is fierce!” exclaimed Bob, for the tent
he and Ned were under had gone down. “Can’t
we find some other shelter?”</p>

<p>Jerry came out into the storm and darkness to
look about. He realized that he was responsible
for the comfort of his men.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>IN THE OLD BARN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>If there is one thing more than another which
makes life in camp, whether it be in the army or
merely a pleasure excursion in the woods, most
miserable, it is rain. Snow does not seem so bad,
but a soaking rain seems not only to wet one
through literally, but also mentally. It depresses
the spirits, though, in itself, a good rain is a
blessing.</p>

<p>“I say, Corporal!” called Charles Hatton, one
of the recruits out with the hiking squad.
“There’s an old barn not far off. I’ll be washed
away soon. We could go into that shack out of
the rain, I should think.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, too,” agreed Jerry. “We’ll
do it. I didn’t suppose the storm would be as
bad as this, or we’d have gone into the barn in
the first place. However, it isn’t too late, except
that we’re already wet through.”</p>

<p>“But we can dry out in there, and have a good
night’s sleep,” said Bob, who loved his creature
comforts, including sleeping and eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry gave the necessary orders. The dog tents
were struck, those that had blown down were recovered
and, carrying their packs, the boys made
a rush through the storm for a somewhat dilapidated
and seemingly deserted barn which stood in
a field, not far from the spot where camp had first
been made.</p>

<p>“Well, this is something like!” exclaimed Ned,
as they entered the structure. The swinging
doors, sagging on their hinges, had not been
locked, but, even if they had been, Jerry felt he
would have been justified in breaking them open,
agreeing to pay for the damage done, as he was
authorized to do.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s some hay I’m going to hit, as
soon as I get dried out a bit,” declared Bob, as he
flashed his electric light on the mow. It was not
full, but enough hay remained to make a good bed
for the tired soldiers.</p>

<p>They had eaten their supper, and there was
nothing to do but to stretch out and wait for morning,
when they would be warmed by hot coffee
which they could make for themselves. They
carried a little solidified-alcohol stove for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The boys took off some of their wet garments
and spread them out to dry. Then they laid their
blankets on the hay and prepared for a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
night’s rest than would have been possible under
the tents, even if it had not rained.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” said Ned, as Jerry
went to see that the doors were fastened, for, in
a measure, he was responsible for the safety of
the property of whoever owned the old barn.</p>

<p>It was a very old one, and there seemed to be
no house near it, but then the boys could not see
very well in the storm and the darkness, and they
were in a rolling country, so that the farmhouse
might have been down in one of the many hollows
surrounding the barn.</p>

<p>The building leaked in places, and two of the
young volunteers had to move their blankets after
they had spread them out, to avoid streams of
water that trickled down on them. But at last
all were settled and ready for the night’s repose.</p>

<p>There was no need of posting a sentry, so each
one had his full rest. Jerry fell asleep with the
others. How long he slumbered he did not know,
but he was suddenly awakened by hearing, almost
directly under him, the sound of voices.</p>

<p>Though he awoke, Jerry did not immediately
get up to see who it was. He was not yet fully
aroused. At first he thought it might be some
of his own squad, who had found themselves unable
to sleep, and who hoped to pass away the
hours of the night in talk.</p>

<p>“But that won’t do,” thought Jerry. “If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
want to gas they’ve got to go somewhere else.
We want to sleep.”</p>

<p>However, as he became more thoroughly
awake, and listened more intently to the talk, he
realized that it was none of his friends.</p>

<p>The voices were those of men—three of them,
evidently, to judge by the different intonations—and
they rose and fell in varying accents, the
murmur now becoming loud and again soft. And
the men seemed very much in earnest.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were sleeping in what had
been the hay-mow, but the mow was a double one.
That is, there was a platform, built up about ten
feet above the barn floor, and this platform, the
floor of which was of closely-laid poles, served to
support the hay, of which there was still quite a
layer there.</p>

<p>Below this was an open space, in which there
was some straw. It was a double mow, in other
words, the upper part used for hay and the
lower for straw. In front of the two mows was
an open space, forming the main floor of the barn,
on which stood some wagons and farm machinery,
and on the other side of this was another big mow,
used evidently for the storage of only one kind
of farm produce, since it was not divided.</p>

<p>Unrolling himself from his blankets, and making
as little disturbance as possible in this operation,
Jerry made his way to the edge of the mow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and looked down. It was ten feet to the barn
floor, and there was a ladder at one side, up which
the boys had climbed.</p>

<p>Down below him, seated around a lantern, the
glow of which was dimmed by an old coat wrapped
about it, Jerry saw three ragged and drenched
men.</p>

<p>“Tramps!” was his instant thought. “They
came in here just as we did, to get out of the rain.”</p>

<p>The rain was still coming down in torrents, as
evidenced by the rattle on the barn roof, and
Jerry was about to crawl back and go to sleep
again, reasoning that the tramps had as much
right in the barn as had he and his squad, when
something happened to make him change his
plans.</p>

<p>One of the men by a quick motion accidentally
disturbed the coat shrouding the lantern, and a
bright gleam shot out at one side. This gleam
revealed something that made Jerry start and
catch his breath.</p>

<p>“Crooked Nose!” he exclaimed in a whisper,
as he stared at one of the three men gathered
about the lantern. “There’s old Crooked Nose!
And this time we ought to catch him, sure!”</p>

<p>For a daring plan had instantly occurred to
Jerry. He and his chums could make prisoners
of the three men, including the mysterious one
who had been seen in Cresville the night of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
fire. Of course, in a way, it was taking a risk,
not only of bodily harm, but also because the
young soldiers had no right to detain the men,
against only one of whom was there any suspicion,
and but slight suspicion at that.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to get ’em and see what it all
means,” decided Jerry. “I wish I had a little
more evidence to go on, though, and I wish I
knew who those other two were.”</p>

<p>“Easy with the light there,” growled the man
with the crooked nose, as he replaced the coat his
companion had dislodged. “Do you want to
bring the farmer and his dogs down on us?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’ll be out such a night,” was the answer.
“You’re too much afraid. Freitlach!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” exclaimed the other. “Didn’t I tell
you not to use that name? Don’t use any names.”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t be so afraid!” taunted the third
man—the one who had his back toward Jerry.
“You’re nervous.”</p>

<p>“And so would you be if you’d done what I
have. If they catch me—” and the man with
the crooked nose looked apprehensively over his
shoulder into the dark shadows of the barn.</p>

<p>“That’s it; he’s too much afraid,” said the
man with his back toward Jerry. “He’s always
afraid!”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of too much,” sneered the man
who had displaced the coat. “He’s afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
give us our share of the swag, and I want mine,
too. I’m tired of waiting. I want to have a
settlement and get out. That’s what I told you
when we met to-night, and that’s what I’m going
to have. I’ve starved and begged long enough.
Now I want my share!” and he banged his fist on
the loose boards of the barn floor, close to the
lantern, setting it to swaying so that the man with
the crooked nose exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Stop, you idiot! Do you want to set the place
on fire?”</p>

<p>“Well, it wouldn’t be the first place we’ve
burned,” declared the other, but the words died
on his lips as the other struck him across the
mouth.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” demanded the man
who had roused the ire of the one with the
crooked nose.</p>

<p>“It means to keep still! Do you want to blow
the whole thing?”</p>

<p>“Might as well!” was the sullen answer. “I
want my share. I don’t care what happens after
that. I’m going to skip out. I s’pose you’re going
to stay, Smelzer, until——”</p>

<p>“Never mind about me,” growled the man
whose face Jerry could not see. “Pug and I have
some plans of our own. They’ve been busted up
some, but I guess we can carry ’em out somehow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want my share,” went on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
speaking to the one with the mis-shapen nose. “I
need the coin, and I’m going to have it. I did my
share of the work, and I want my share of the
swag. When you got me in on the scheme,
Freit——”</p>

<p>“What’d I tell you about names?” fiercely demanded
the crooked-nosed man.</p>

<p>“Well, when you got me in on the scheme you
said the Frenchman had a pot of money, and a
lot of jewelry, too.”</p>

<p>“So he did have!” declared Crooked Nose. “I
got part of it. I admitted that. But the biggest
part is there yet. It may be in the ruins of the
fire——”</p>

<p>“Yes, the fire I set to give you a chance to get
the coin!” broke in the other. “Now I’m tired
of fooling. Either I get half the money you got
from the old Frenchman, or I’ll go back to Cresville
and see what I can find in the fire ruins! I’m
going to get something for the risk I took. Give
me half the money you got from the old man the
night of the fire, or I’ll squeal! That’s my last
word!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE ROUND-UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins, lying in the haymow and looking
down at the men and listening to them, could
hardly believe his senses. At last it was all clear
to him. Before him was the crooked-nosed man
who had been seen in Cresville the night of the
tenement house fire. And now, by his own admission,
there was the man who had set the blaze
so the robbery could be carried out with less fear
of detection. As to the third man, Jerry did not
know what to think. His mention of “Pug”
seemed to link him with the bully, Kennedy, but
this yet remained to be proved.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m sure of one thing,” decided
Jerry, as he looked back into the dark mow, and
could detect no movement that would indicate his
chums were awake. “Crooked Nose is the man
who robbed old Mr. Cardon, and the other chap
is the one who set the fire. They’re both guilty
by their own admission. But where is his other
money if these fellows didn’t get it? And the
brooch and the watch? I wonder if they could
be in the ruins?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry was thinking quickly. There was much
to do if he hoped to capture the three men and
fasten their crimes on them. First he must
awaken some of his companions, and let them
listen to the incriminating talk.</p>

<p>Jerry crawled to where his two friends were
sleeping. He first awakened Ned, and clapped a
hand over his mouth to silence any sudden exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Ned demanded.</p>

<p>“Crooked Nose!” whispered Jerry. “Keep
still! I think we have them!”</p>

<p>Bob was harder to arouse, and inclined to make
more noise, but at length the three motor boys,
leaving the other soldiers sleeping in the hay, had
crawled to the edge of the mow and were looking
down on the three men gathered about the shaded
lantern. The discussion was still going on.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wait?” begged the crooked-nosed
man, who had given his name to Mr. Martin
as Jim Waydell. “Why do you want to spoil
things now?” and he addressed the fellow who
had displaced the coat, which had been adjusted
again, however. “Why don’t you wait?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m tired of waiting,” was the
growled-out answer. “I want some coin. I set
the fire. You robbed the Frenchman. It was
fifty-fifty with the risk. Now let it be the same
with the coin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I tell you I haven’t got much coin left,”
declared Crooked Nose. “We missed the biggest
bunch of it, and what I got——”</p>

<p>“Give me half of what you got then!” growled
the other.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I had to spend some——”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud!” warned the man whose
face was in the shadow. “First thing you know
some one may hear us, and then——” He
shrugged his shoulders, as though no words were
necessary.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” whispered Ned to Jerry. “Is
it possible we have stumbled on the very men we
wanted?”</p>

<p>“More a case of them stumbling in on us,”
Jerry answered. “Listen to what they are saying.”</p>

<p>It was the same argument over again, one man
demanding money and the other trying to pacify
him without giving it.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“Get ’em, of course,” Jerry replied in the same
low voice. “Do you think we three can manage
them alone—each one take a man?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” declared Ned. He and his chums
were in excellent physical condition, thanks to their
army training.</p>

<p>“Well, then let’s jump on ’em. Take ’em by
surprise,” advised the tall lad. “We can slide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
down from the hay and grab ’em before they
know what’s up. We’ve heard enough to convict
them now. It was the very evidence we needed.”</p>

<p>“Better wake up the other fellows so they can
stand by us in case of trouble,” advised Bob, and
this was decided on. While the two men were
still disputing, and their companion waited, Ned,
Bob and Jerry silently roused their sleeping comrades,
briefly telling them what the situation was.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">“We’ll slide down and grab ’em,” said Jerry.</a>
“They don’t appear to be armed, but if they are
we’ll take ’em by surprise before they can get their
guns. You stand by with your rifles, fellows. I
guess the sight of the guns will be all that’s
needed. All ready now?” he asked Ned and Bob
in a whisper.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_240">“WE’LL SLIDE DOWN AND GRAB ’EM,” SAID JERRY.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“All ready!”</p>

<p>The boys had drawn back to the far end of
the haymow to make their plans, so their whispers
would not penetrate to the ears of the men.
But there was little danger of this, as the storm
outside was making too much noise.</p>

<p>The three chums from Cresville now worked
their way to the edge of the haymow. The men
were still below them, Crooked Nose and his companion
angrily arguing, while the other man had
risen. For the first time Jerry and his chums
had a glimpse of the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve seen him somewhere before,” decided
Jerry.</p>

<p>But there was no time then for such speculation.
The men must be caught.</p>

<p>Poised on the very edge of the haymow, Jerry
and his chums waited a moment. They were going
to jump down the ten feet and rush at the
men. There was a litter of straw below them
which would break the force of their leap.</p>

<p>“Go!” suddenly whispered Jerry.</p>

<p>Three bodies shot over the edge of the haymow,
landing with a thud on the barn floor. The
men, hearing the noise and feeling the concussion,
turned quickly. A sudden motion of one again
displaced the coat over the lantern, so that the
scene was well lighted.</p>

<p>“They’ve got us!” yelled Crooked Nose, and
he made a rush, but Jerry Hopkins caught him in
his long arms.</p>

<p>“Get out the way!” shouted the man who had
been begging for a division of the spoils, as he
headed for Ned like a football player trying to
avoid a tackle. But Ned was used to such tactics.
He downed his man hard, the thud shaking the
barn.</p>

<p>Bob did not have such luck. His man crashed
full into him, knocked Bob to one side and then
disappeared in some dark recess of the barn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Chunky, somewhat dazed, rose slowly and tried
to follow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerry and Ned were struggling with
the two men they had caught. The outcome was
in doubt, for the prisoners were desperate. But
the advent of the other soldiers sliding down from
the haymow with rifles ready for use, soon settled
the matter.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” sharply ordered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to,” sullenly agreed the
crooked-nosed man.</p>

<p>“Now find the other fellow,” Jerry ordered,
when the men had been tied with ropes, which
had been found in the barn.</p>

<p>But this was more easily said than done. Using
the lantern and their electric searchlights the boys
hunted through the barn, but the third man was
not to be found.</p>

<p>“He got away,” said Bob regretfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry,” returned Jerry consolingly.
“We got the two main ones, anyhow. And
maybe these fellows will have something on them
to tell who the other fellow was.”</p>

<p>The prisoners did not answer, but they looked
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a good night’s work,” declared
Jerry, when he and his chums had a chance to talk
matters over. “We’ve got the robber and the
firebug, and I guess we can help get back most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the Frenchman’s money and maybe the gold
watch and the diamond brooch. They are back
in the fire ruins, I imagine.”</p>

<p>By turns Ned, Bob and Jerry explained to their
companions the reason for capturing Crooked
Nose and the other man, relating the story of
the fire in Cresville some months back.</p>

<p>There was little sleep for any one the rest of
that night. A guard was posted over the two
prisoners, when a search had failed to reveal the
missing third man, and in the morning, after a
hasty breakfast in the old barn, the march back to
camp was made. The storm was over.</p>

<p>There was some surprise when Jerry and his
chums returned with their prisoners. Captain
Trainer, when he heard the story, had the men
locked up in the guardhouse until the civil authorities
could be communicated with, as the crime
was not a military one.</p>

<p>And, a little later, Hans Freitlach, <em>alias</em> Jim
Waydell, the crooked-nosed man, and Fritz Lebhach,
his companion, were safely in jail, and some
papers found on them disclosed their real identity.</p>

<p>They were German spies, being members of a
band that had for its object the destruction of munition
plants and warehouses and factories, where
war goods for our government and the Allies were
being stored and made. They had set a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of fires, it was learned afterward, though the one
in Cresville had been a personal matter, designed
to get hold of the old Frenchman’s money. After
that crime Freitlach and Lebhach had fled, agreeing
to meet later in the South, as they did, much
to their own discomfort.</p>

<p>“And who do you think that other man was—the
one that bowled Bob over?” asked Jerry,
rushing excitedly up to his chums a few days after
the men had been sent to Cresville to await trial.</p>

<p>“Haven’t an idea, unless he was some football
star,” Chunky ruefully answered, remembering his
failure to tackle.</p>

<p>“He was Pug Kennedy’s step-father!” was the
unexpected information Jerry gave.</p>

<p>“Pug Kennedy’s step-father!” exclaimed Ned
and Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes. His name is Meyer, and he’s another
German spy, and so is Pug. Meyer masqueraded
as an Irishman, for he had been pals with an Irish
prize-fighter for some years.”</p>

<p>“And was it his father Pug sneaked out to meet
at night?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry. “Since Pug has deserted
the whole story has come out. His father
was another spy, and his particular work was to
make trouble in camps—set fire to storehouses,
quartermasters’ depots and the like. Pug was
going to help him, and that’s why he enlisted—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rotten traitor! But he’s gone, and the Secret
Service men hope to catch them both.”</p>

<p>A week later came back word from Cresville
that filled the young soldiers with keen satisfaction.
The ashes of the tenement house fire had
been thoroughly searched and an iron box belonging
to the French engraver had been recovered.
It contained a large part of the old man’s
money and also Mr. Baker’s gold watch.</p>

<p>“I’m glad dad has his watch back,” said Bob.
“But what about the diamond brooch belonging
to Jerry’s mother?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll get that later,” said Jerry hopefully.</p>

<p>And they did, although not in the manner expected.
The doings of the crooked-nosed man
were minutely investigated, and it was finally
learned where he had left the brooch with a pawn-broker
for a small amount—thinking to get it
out of pawn later on and sell it, when it might be
safe to do so. The authorities took charge of
the valuable piece of jewelry, and it was finally
turned over to Mrs. Hopkins, much to her delight.</p>

<p>The thief and the firebug received long terms
in state’s prison—terms which were richly deserved.</p>

<p>As for Pug, the military authorities made a
search for him after his desertion, which followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the capture of the two men, but he was not found.
It was surmised that his step-father got word to
him, somehow, after the former’s escape from the
barn, that the game was up, and that Pug had better
flee. So he did.</p>

<p>The crooked-nosed man and his companion both
declared that Pug and his father helped plot the
Cresville fire, and wanted to have a share in the
proceeds of the robbery. Whether this was true
or not could not be learned.</p>

<p>It was learned that Mr. Cardon had, at one
time, done some business with Crooked Nose, as
it is easier to call him than using one of his many
false names. But the unscrupulous one had
cheated the Frenchman, and then, later, using the
knowledge he had of his wealth and habits, had
tried to rob him, getting a confederate to set the
fire. The men had gone South after the Cresville
crimes because Pug was sent there, and they
wanted to keep in touch with him. But, thanks to
the activities of Ned, Bob and Jerry, the gang’s
operations were successfully broken up.</p>

<p>To the barracks, where Ned, Bob and Jerry
were sitting and talking, there penetrated the clear
notes of a bugle.</p>

<p>“What’s that—another drill?” asked Ned,
starting up.</p>

<p>“The mail has come,” interpreted Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, boy!” yelled Bob, making a rush for the
door.</p>

<p>A little later all three were reading letters and
looking over papers from home.</p>

<p>“Good news, Chunky?” asked Ned, as he saw
a smile light up his stout chum’s face.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!” was the answer.
“Helena writes to say that her father has changed
his views, and that they’re both real Americans
now. She says she likes me better than ever for
being in the army and—— Oh, I didn’t mean to
read that!” and Bob blushed. “It was something
about the Red Cross I was going to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Bob!” laughed Jerry. “Helena’s all
right!”</p>

<p>It was that evening, in the free period between
the last mess and taps, that a cheering was heard
in a distant part of the camp.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jerry of his two friends.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve caught Pug Kennedy,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“I hope it’s better news than that,” Jerry remarked.</p>

<p>“It is,” Bob informed them, when he came back
from a hasty trip of inquiry. “We’ve received
orders to move.”</p>

<p>“Move? Move where?”</p>

<p>“Over there!”</p>

<p>A cheer from his chums interrupted Bob’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
words, and for some time there was such confusion
that any connected story of it was out of the
question.</p>

<p>But those of you who wish to follow the further
fortunes of Ned, Bob and Jerry may read of other
adventures that befell them in the next volume of
this series entitled, “The Motor Boys on the Firing
Line, or, Ned, Bob and Jerry Fighting for
Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>“Well, we put in quite a summer, didn’t we?”
observed Jerry to his chums one day, as they came
back from a practice hike. “We had some lively
times.”</p>

<p>“And we may have more,” added Ned. “I
just had a letter from Professor Snodgrass. He
says he’s coming on another bug-hunting trip. I’m
going to tell the captain to warn the sentries not
to shoot when they see a bald head.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” laughed Jerry. And while
the motor boys are talking over their various
adventures we will take leave of them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
